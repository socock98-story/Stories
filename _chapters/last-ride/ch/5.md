I was on him reverse cowgirl, palms braced on his thighs, bouncing hard. Even after a month of dating, he still stretched me in new ways. His hands spread me, thumbs digging into my hips, guiding me down.
“That’s a nice fucking ass,” he said, a smack landing hot. “Ride it, baby.”
I ground down and felt him hit deep. “Oh fuck—yes. Fill me up,” I said. “Please.”
His grip tightened. “Take it. Take all of it.”
I lost the rhythm and just rolled my hips, chasing it. The pressure snapped; I spilled with a shout I couldn’t swallow. He drove up into me once, twice, and I felt him thicken and go—warm pulses deep, nothing between us. I groaned and sagged forward on the bed.
He slipped out as I tipped onto my forearms, catching my breath. Wet heat slid down my thigh.
“Ah— you’re dripping me everywhere,” he laughed, breathless.
“And whose fault is that?” I said, laughing too.
“Yours.”
“I’m pretty sure it’s because you dumped a gallon in me. Your loads are huge.”
“That’s your fault because you’re too damn sexy,” he said, pulling me in for a kiss.
I turned and stretched out beside him. We settled into the usual—his arm over me, my leg thrown across his. The room was quiet except for our breathing.
“This has been going good,” I said, a little shy.
“This has been going very good,” he said, kissing me.
“I told my parents I was dating a man,” I said. “They were… surprisingly cool.”
“Yeah, mine too,” he said. “They kind of knew I’d fooled around with guys, so it wasn’t a shock.”
“That’s cool.” I traced a line over his chest and let my hand rest there. “I feel comfortable with this.”
“Me too,” he said, smiling at me. “I think it’s time to be open about it.”
“Yeah,” I said, and kissed him. “Well, there’s no rush anyway.”

I slipped out by the side stair in the morning like usual. The group chat buzzed before I’d even hit the quad.
Grayson: House meeting at 10. Lounge.
I showered, changed, and headed back. Most of the guys were already there—Tom and Donovan on the couch, Craig at the kitchen island, a couple of seniors leaning on the doorway. I slid in next to Tom.
“You know what this is?” I asked.
“Probably midterm damage control,” he said. “Or Craig wants to ban flip cup.”
“Never,” Craig said, overhearing.
Grayson came in with James and Damian and clapped once. The room settled.
“Alright,” he said. “End of the year’s coming. We’re dialing back parties so people pass their classes. After finals, we’ll do one big send-off. We’re bringing back Rodeo Night.”
A little cheer went up—whistles, someone yelled “Yeehaw.” Craig did a stupid lasso motion that made the guys laugh.
Grayson lifted a hand. “Cool it.” He glanced around, calm. “One more thing. Heads up for the house.”
He looked at me, then back at everyone. “Evan and I are dating. Been about a month. Any issues with it?”
Silence for half a second. Then Craig: “About time.” James: “W.” Donovan whooped and slapped my shoulder. A scatter of claps. No one looked weird about it. A couple guys gave me a chin nod like, nice.
“Good,” Grayson said, like he’d expected that. “Back to finals. Study. Don’t be dumb. Meeting over.”
The room broke into chatter. Tom turned to me. “Bro. Congrats.”
“Proud of you, man,” Donovan said, pulling me into a quick hug that smelled like laundry detergent and last night’s cologne.
I opened my mouth to say thanks and Grayson cut through the crowd to me. He gave me a quick kiss—nothing performative, just there—and tapped my hip.
“Breakfast?” he said.
“Yeah,” I said.
We walked out together. He laced our fingers as we hit the sidewalk, casual. A couple of guys coming in saw and just nodded like it was normal. It felt… normal.
We cut across the quad toward the diner, his hand still in mine.

***

A month later, everything was just… good.
Being out didn’t change the house much. If anything, it made things easier. Guys chirped the same as before, just with a couple new jokes. Craig called us “Are & Bee” once and got booed for it. On campus, a few people double-took the first week we held hands; then it was background. No drama. No whispers that mattered. Normal.
Grayson and I were easy too. Breakfast runs, study side-by-side, gym spots, movie nights that actually ended with sleep sometimes. Sex stayed great. The best part, though, was the stretch in between—the quick shoulder bump in the hall, the “you eating?” text, a kiss on my way to class because we could.
One afternoon Craig flagged me at the kitchen island, notebook open, pen tapping.
“Evan. You busy?”
“Depends,” I said. “If it’s moving a couch, suddenly yes.”
He snorted. “Final party. I want you on planning with me.”
“Like… co-lead?” I tried not to grin like a pledge.
“Yeah. You’ve already been running half our logistics anyway. I need someone who actually shows up on time, keeps budgets straight, and can herd idiots.” He flipped his notebook to a page labeled RODEO. “Bull rental, permits, mats, lighting, sound, back-yard layout, security, the works.”
“Holy—okay. Yes. I’m in.”
“Good. Start with confirming the bull and the safety gear. We’re not getting sued on my watch.”
I found Grayson in the lounge half-watching a game with James. I sat on the arm of his chair and told him.
“Craig asked me to co-plan the finale.”
Grayson looked up, smile quick and real. “No way. That’s sick.”
“Did you put him up to it?”
“Nope.” He shook his head. “He chose you. You earned it.”
That landed warm. I bumped his shoulder and he bumped back. When the game cut to commercial, he tilted his head toward the hall.
“Room?”
We took the main stairs. Halfway up I laughed. “It still feels weird taking these to your room. I’m used to the side stair.”
“Get used to it,” he said, glancing back with a small grin. “You’re not taking those anymore.”
His room was the same as always—clean enough, weights in the corner, TV paused on a menu. He closed the door and leaned against it. I stepped in, hands sliding to his waist. He kissed me once, easy.
“You know,” I said, “we’re still not fully equal.”
He cocked a brow. “How so?”
I squeezed his ass.
“Oh,” he said. “That.”
“That,” I said, looking at him.
He huffed a quiet laugh and rubbed the back of his neck. “I’ve never done that before.”
“Is that a no?”
“It’s a ‘be careful.’ I haven’t done it before.”
“We don’t have to do it now. Or soon,” I said, taking his hands and placing them on my hips. “Tonight you take care of me.”
“When have I not?” he said, smug and soft at once.
“Never. That’s why I like you.”
He smiled and pulled me in. We kissed, unhurried. The TV timed out and the room went dimmer. We stood there a while, just breathing the same air, and it felt like balance.

***

Finals and party prep blurred into a good kind of busy.
— Library, group room again. Glass walls, hum out in the hall. Tyler and Luis already there; Mia slid in a minute late with a coffee and a pen stuck in her hair.
 “Practice set?” Tyler asked.
 “Yeah,” I said, opening my notebook.
 We fell into it—problems, checkpoints, quick jokes. At a water break, Mia nudged me with her elbow.
 “Saw you with your boyfriend,” she said, light. “Happy for you.”
 “Thanks,” I said.
 She smiled and went back to circling my answers. We worked another hour. It felt steady. Focused. Normal.
— Back at the house, Craig’s notebook was open on the island, columns and checkboxes everywhere.
 “Status,” he said.
 “Bull confirmed,” I said. “Operator brings mats and barriers. Deposit sent. Delivery at four, pickup at one. Waivers printed. Sound and lights booked. Backup generator on hold. Security shifts set.”
 Craig checked boxes like a judge. “Good. Permits?”
 “Handled. I’ll drop the copy to the RA tomorrow.”
 “CO2?”
 “New line installed. I tested it. Twice.”
 He smirked. “Proud of you.”
 We sketched the backyard layout on printer paper—bull in the back corner, entrance funnel, rope line, tables along the fence, extra trash cans, a water station. He handed me a stack of wristbands and a marker. “Door crew schedule,” he said. “Make them stick to it.”
— Texts to Grayson during the week:
 Me: Operator’s chill. Bull’s coming early so we can test.
 Grayson: Perfect. I’ll be there.
 Me: Do we warn the neighbors?
 Grayson: Already did. Dropped off earplugs.
 Me: Nerd.
 Grayson: Your nerd.
— Tom and Donovan helped me string lights in the yard. Donovan almost ate it off the ladder; Tom caught the ladder and yelled at him like a dad. We laughed too hard for how basic the job was. I taped down cords, marked tripping spots with bright gaff, and set up a bin labeled WATER ONLY that would be ignored in under an hour.
— Study blocks in between. I ran another practice exam with Tyler, checked answers with Luis, traded formulas with Mia. When the mock went well, I didn’t celebrate out loud. I just felt a small click inside, the good kind. Thanks to all our studying, finals went well and I was ready to end the year.

Night before the party, Craig and I walked the yard with a flashlight like we were inspecting a set.
 “Looks clean,” he said.
 “It’ll look wrecked by midnight,” I said.
 He grinned. “That’s the point. You ready?”
 “Yeah,” I said. And I was.


The yard looked like a county fair by midnight—string lights, cacti backdrop, the bull already scuffed from a dozen wipeouts. Country remixes bled into rap and back again. Inside, the island was a minefield of cups and chips. No brackets this time, just whoever wanted to try stuff tried it.
I did one last logistics loop—checked cords, gave the operator a thumbs-up, told door crew to swap wrists—and then let myself be a guest. Grayson stuck with me. He had on a fitted black tee and his backwards cap; I’d gone simple. We moved together—kitchen to lounge to back patio—saying hi to everyone.
“Planner man,” Craig called from the island, thumping a hand on a cooler. “Bull guy says you’re his favorite client. That true?”
“I bribed him with pizza,” I said.
“Smart,” Craig said. “No catastrophes on my watch.”
James leaned in. “He means your watch,” he said to me. “I saw you taping down cords like OSHA.”
“Somebody’s gotta keep you from suing us,” I said.
Tom and Donovan rolled up with shots. “To Rodeo Night 2,” Tom said. We clinked, made faces, laughed. Donovan gestured toward the yard. “I ate it off that thing. Knee still mad at me.”
“You went way too hard on Level 1,” I said.
“Go big or go limp,” he said solemnly.
We got dragged into a dance pocket in the living room. It wasn’t pretty, but nobody cared. Grayson spun me once just to be stupid; I flipped him off and kissed him quick. A couple of guys cheered. Someone yelled “power couple” and Craig booed them for being cheesy, which made it funnier.

We did the rounds: attempted the lasso ring (I missed; Grayson landed one and pretended it was skill), cornhole (Donovan smoked us), photo backdrop (Craig forced a stupid hat on Grayson; he wore it for one picture and then stuck it on me). It was hot and crowded and the backyard felt alive.
A chant started somewhere—“off! off! off!”—and shirts started flying. Grayson peeled his tee and tossed it to Tom; I pulled mine because it was too warm anyway. Someone returned Grayson’s cap and set it back on his head like crowning a king. We kissed when we felt like it. Not a show, just there. No one blinked.
We watched a few bull rides from the rails: a couple from another frat trying to double up and bailing at three seconds; two seniors who clung on pure spite; Donovan, true to form, lasting five seconds and dismounting like he meant to before almost face-planting. The operator was in a mood—he had a gleam that said he liked sending people into the mats.
Near one, Craig climbed a chair with a plastic megaphone. “Final calls for the bull,” he shouted. “Then we shut it down before housing shuts us down. Last up… Alpha Rho’s power couple. Close us out!”
The crowd turned and whooped. Grayson looked at me, head tilted. “You want it?”
“Yes,” I said, leaning in so only he heard. “But this time you ride in front.”
His eyes flashed like he remembered exactly what that meant. “Deal.”
We hopped the rail. The operator grinned like he knew the story. Grayson climbed first and slid forward, close to the neck. I swung up behind him. My thighs bracketed his; I took his hips in both hands. He reached back and squeezed my wrist once.
“You good?” he called over the motor.
“I’ve got you,” I said into his ear.
The bull kicked on. He hugged the neck, leaning with it; I let my hips follow his. When it snapped right, I steadied his waist and kept us centered. When it bucked, I absorbed the jolt and stayed tight to his back. The crowd noise blurred to a wash. It felt like the first night and nothing like it—his back under my chest, my hands on him, public and ours at the same time.
We got past the usual dump point. The operator smirked and twisted the knob. The bull got meaner. Grayson adjusted, forearms flexing; I held him and let my grind stay a shade longer than necessary. He didn’t move away. If anything, he pressed into me. Someone yelled “Don’t fall!” like we were going to. We didn’t.
The whistle blew. The motor died. We were both breathing hard and laughing. I slid off first and held a hand; he jumped down and took it.
Craig ran up waving his stopwatch. “New record!” he yelled. “Again. Disgusting.”
I stepped in, mouth at Grayson’s ear. “Felt good, didn’t it?”
He looked at me, eyes still bright from the ride. “Yes,” he said. “Really good.”
We got swallowed back into the party—high fives, someone shoving a beer into my hand, Tom and Donovan shouting about the time like we’d won a championship. The music dipped a notch. People started drifting toward the front. I did one last loop—told the operator we’d see him at pickup, thanked door crew, set two trash bags by the exit table.
Inside, the house had that late hum. Fewer people. Softer voices. Grayson found my hand, squeezed once, and tugged. No words.
We moved through the hall and up the main stairs, past the side door we didn’t use anymore. He didn’t look back to check if I was coming.
He didn’t have to. 

His door shut and I was already in his hands.
“So tonight’s my night, huh?” he murmured against my mouth.
“My first time was after Rodeo Night,” I said. “Figured yours should be, too. If you want to.”
“I do.”
I smiled and kissed him again. Clothes went quick. His palms mapped me—chest, hips, the back of my neck. I traced the lines I knew by heart, then the ones I didn’t—lower, slower—until we were breathing in the same small space and the bed hit the backs of my knees.
He pushed me down and went first. His mouth was warm and sure around me, no rush, just steady pulls and a hand snug at the base. I let my head tip back and pushed my fingers through his hair. He looked up once, eyes dark, then sank again and I groaned, hips twitching before he stilled them with a palm to my stomach.
“Trade,” I said, voice rough.
He climbed up, kissed me wet and open, and I slid down his body. I took him into my mouth and he swore—short, surprised. He was thick; I worked what I could, tongue dragging the underside, hand twisting the rest. His thigh flexed under my forearm. I let him see me do it; he let his head fall back and breathed my name like a new word.
I pushed his knees up and kissed lower. First time. He tensed, then let go, and I took my time. Tongue, then lips, then tongue again until his breath went ragged. I reached for the lube and slicked my fingers. One. Slow. Let him breathe. Two, careful. He clutched the sheet and blinked up at me, cheeks flushed, a little stunned. I smiled, kissed the inside of his knee, added a third when he nodded. He opened around me, warm and tight in a way that made my chest feel too full.
I crawled back up and kissed him. Close. “You sure?”
“Yes.” No hesitation. “I want you.”
I lined up and pushed in slow. The heat of him knocked the air out of me. He grabbed my shoulders and held, eyes on mine, brow tight until I stopped and kissed him through it. We breathed together. He loosened under me; I sank the rest of the way with a sound I couldn’t help.
“Talk to me,” I said, voice thin.
“Good,” he said, exhaling. “Different. Keep it slow.”
I did. Small moves at first, shallow, just enough to feel the drag and let him meet me. His hands slid to my back, then my jaw. He pulled me down so our chests touched. I kissed his mouth, his cheek, the corner where his smile lived. He smiled into the kiss when the hurt shifted to heat.
“More,” he said, and I gave him more. Deeper. A little faster. He swore, head tipping back, throat open. I held his face and watched him take me, watched the flickers run across his eyes, watched him steady under me like he’d found his balance.
“Switch?” he asked, breathless, a spark in it.
“Yeah.”
He eased me out and sat up. He climbed into my lap facing me, knees outside my hips, and took me in his hand. “Guide me,” he said, voice low.
I did. He sank down slow, controlled, a long shiver running through him until he was full. We both stopped there, breathing. He put his hands on my shoulders and rolled his hips once, careful, then again with more confidence. I braced my hands on his waist and let him set it. The angle was different—closer, deeper in a way that made my vision spark at the edges. He rode me steady, then harder when I met him from below. Sweat slid along his ribs under my palms. His mouth found mine and he swallowed the sounds we made.
“Fuck, Evan,” he said against my cheek. “You feel… good.”
“So do you,” I said, and it came out like a groan.
He bounced once, twice, then ground down and I lost the thread. Pressure coiled tight; I wrapped an arm around his back and held him there, chest to chest, and thrust up into him, small and quick. He gasped and grabbed the back of my neck, forehead pressed to mine.
“I’m close,” I warned.
“Yeah,” he said, nodding, pupils blown. “Give it to me.”
I pulled him down into a kiss and let go, buried deep, pulse after pulse rolling out of me into him. He shook in my arms and held me through it, breath breaking against my mouth.
“Don’t move,” he said, and reached down. I was still inside him when he wrapped himself and stroked. I kissed his throat, his jaw, his mouth again. He rocked on me and came with a cut-off sound, hot across my stomach, his body clenching around me in a way that sent a last tremor through my legs.
We froze there, stuck together, laughing breathlessly at how wrecked we were. He shifted and I slid out; warmth bled down his thigh and he made a surprised face that turned into a grin.
“Okay,” he said, sucking in a breath. “That was—”
“Amazing,” I finished, panting. “Yeah.”
We grabbed a towel and did a lazy, terrible job of cleaning up, then fell back into the pillows. He kissed me, slow and soft, like we had forever to get it right. I kissed him back and started laughing again for no reason.
“What?” he asked, smiling.
“Just—” I shook my head. “You. Us.”
“Yeah,” he said, brushing his thumb over my cheek. “Us.”
We kissed again, still grinning, still out of breath.
We were still catching our breath, grinning, when he rolled toward me and kissed me again—slow, like he wasn’t done with the night.
“My turn,” he said, voice rough in a way that went straight through me.
I nodded. “Yeah.”
He kissed down my chest and stomach, lazy, then grabbed the lube from the drawer. Warm hands on my hips. He slicked his fingers and worked me open again—easy this time, patient like he always got when it mattered. I relaxed under him and let the room narrow to breath and touch.
“Come here,” he said, tugging my thigh.
He pulled me to the edge of the bed and stood, body a clean line in the low light. He lifted my legs onto his shoulders, bent over me, and slid in slow. No rush. Heat and weight sank deep and I exhaled into his collarbone, hands on his back to steady the little shakes in my legs.
“Good?” he asked, close to my ear.
“Yeah,” I said. “Yeah, Gray.”
He set a rhythm that felt like he’d thought about it—steady to start, small adjustments until I made a sound I didn’t plan. He chased that angle, a little deeper each time. I dragged my nails lightly down to his waist and felt him shiver. He kissed my jaw, then my mouth, keeping the motion without breaking the kiss, a quiet show-off that made me laugh into it.
He eased my legs down and shifted us to our sides, spooning me from behind, staying inside the whole time. His arm slipped under my head and his other hand threaded our fingers together on my chest. He rolled his hips slow, all pressure and drag and closeness. I pushed back, breath hitching. The bed creaked once like it approved.
“Turn,” he murmured.
I rolled to my back and he followed, braced on his forearms, faces close. He watched me as he moved—eyes steady, not letting me look anywhere else. It felt new even though it wasn’t. The room went quiet except for the sounds we made. I wrapped my legs around him and held him there, pulled him in when he tried to lift, kept him close.
“I’m close,” I said.
He nodded, didn’t speed up, just stayed with me. His hand slid between us and wrapped me, stroking in time with the push and pull. The edge hit fast. I broke with it—muscles tight, spilling between us, mouth open on a breath that didn’t land.
He kept going through it, mouth finding mine, hips stuttering, breath rough. He pressed in deep and held, body locked against me, a low sound in his throat as he let go. I felt him pulse warm inside me, and the thought of it—him, here, no space between—made a last tremor run through my legs.
We went still. He stayed over me, breathing into my neck. After a beat he pulled out careful and grabbed the towel. We did a half-decent job of wiping down and then didn’t bother pretending to be tidy. He slid back into the bed and I pulled him in. We lay there chest to chest, foreheads touching, the air between us quiet again.
He looked at me like he was lining something up. No panic. Just sure.
“I love you,” he said.
It landed simple and huge. I smiled because I couldn’t not. “I love you, too.”
He kissed me—nothing fancy, just steady—and I kissed him back. We tucked in, legs tangled, his hand warm at my waist. I let my eyes close with that last line still sitting there between us, the good kind of heavy.
