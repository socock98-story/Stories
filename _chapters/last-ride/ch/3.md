I was sprawled across one of the worn-down couches in the frat house lounge, controller in hand, half-focused on the game, half just enjoying the company. The place smelled faintly like pizza and sweat—comforting in a weird, familiar way. Tom and Donovan were yelling at each other over a round of Smash, while James dug through a bag of chips with the desperation of someone who hadn’t eaten since noon.
“Tom, you’re trash,” Donovan laughed, elbowing him. “How are you gonna talk shit and then get three-stocked?”
Tom pointed at the screen like it betrayed him. “Lag.”
“Bro, we’re playing on the same console.”
I chuckled and tossed my head back. It felt good. No pressure. Just normal.
The front door opened and closed with a soft thud, and a moment later Grayson appeared in the doorway, wearing gym shorts and a tank top that clung to his chest like it had been painted on. He had a shaker bottle in one hand and his phone in the other.
“Room smells like ass,” he said casually as he walked in. “You guys shower sometime this week or…?”
James grinned. “You would know, Grayson. You’re the one always sweating like a pig at the gym.”
Grayson dropped into the armchair with a groan. “That’s ‘cause I actually lift things heavier than a pencil, James.”
That got a round of laughter. He smirked, clearly pleased, then leaned forward to grab a handful of chips from the bowl on the table. He didn’t look at me—but not in a cold way. He just… blended in with the group like I did. Like I belonged there too.
We kept playing, the conversation drifting from classes to weekend plans. Someone mentioned a concert coming up. Another guy asked if we still had beer from the last party.
Then, out of nowhere, Tom nodded toward me. “You’re lucky, Evan. No roommate. Must be nice having a whole room to yourself.”
Grayson raised an eyebrow, finally glancing over. “Wait, you don’t have a roommate?”
I shrugged. “Yeah. He dropped out like two weeks in. They haven’t filled the spot yet. Got the whole place to myself.”
He smirked. “Damn. That’s rare. Enjoy it while it lasts.”
It was nothing. Just a passing comment. But something in the way he said it made the back of my neck warm.
The game kept going. At some point, Grayson got up, stretched like he was about to go back to the gym. “Later, bros,” he said, and then, tossing a look over his shoulder, added with a grin: “You too, roomless wonder.”
I rolled my eyes. “Creative.”
He chuckled, heading out of the lounge. I watched him leave—just for a second—then turned back to the screen as someone shouted, “You’re up next, Evan. Don’t embarrass yourself.”

***

The knock came late—two short taps. I cracked the door and found Grayson in a hoodie and joggers, hair still damp from the shower.
“What are you doing here?” I asked, keeping my voice down.
His mouth curved. “You know why.”
He stepped in, nudged the door shut with his heel, and kissed me. Not rushed. Warm. Sure. His hand slid to the back of my neck like he was asking a question I’d already answered. I pulled back just enough to get words out.
“What are you doing? Last time there was no kissing.”
“It depends on the mood,” he said, close enough that I felt the words. “I don’t always like it that rough.”
He kissed me again and the conversation folded. He tasted like mint and something clean. His thumb skimmed my jaw, then he cupped my face and guided my head where he wanted it, unhurried. I felt myself relax into it. My hands found the hem of his hoodie; he lifted his arms and let me pull it up. The T-shirt underneath clung to him, warm from the shower. I slid my palms under it, over the hard lines of his stomach, and he exhaled against my mouth like he’d been waiting for that.
He turned me gently, my back to the door, and kissed down my neck—no hurry, just deliberate pressure that made my knees feel loose. I got his T-shirt off; he stripped mine too, and for a moment we just pressed together, skin to skin, breathing in sync. He palmed my hips, thumbs fitting right into the spots he’d learned already. I didn’t fight it. I didn’t want to.
We stumbled to the bed. He pushed me down, then followed, bracing on his forearms so his weight sank into me without crushing. His mouth roamed—jaw, collarbone, chest—enough to make me tremble. When I reached for his waistband, he caught my wrist, kissed my palm, then guided my hand lower. I fumbled the drawstring; he laughed quietly and finished it for me. We pushed each other out of the rest of it—shoes, joggers, everything landing where it landed. Heat pooled low in my stomach, a slow throb that made it hard to think.
He kissed me while his hand moved between us, steady and practiced. The foil crinkled, quick and sure, and then he was there—lining up, breath warm against my cheek. The first push made me gasp. He stilled, let me adjust, then sank in deeper. My hands gripped his shoulder blades on instinct; he kissed me until my fingers loosened.
He started slow. Measured. The kind of rhythm that ate thought thread by thread. His hand settled on my jaw again, tilting my face so he could keep kissing me through it. Every time I tried to tell myself to hold back, the next wave rolled in and knocked the thought out of me. The bed creaked, his breath roughened, my hips met his without thinking about it. It felt good—too good—and the too was the part that scared me.
He changed angle a little and something inside me lit up. I swore under my breath; he swallowed it with his mouth and kept the pace, deeper now. I clutched at the sheets, at him—any anchor—and then everything tightened at once. Heat burst through my chest and down my legs; my vision sparked at the edges. I came hard, breath shattering against his neck.
He didn’t slow. Two more drives, a rough sound against my ear, and he followed, hips pressed tight, the kind of release that pulled a low groan out of him he probably didn’t mean to let me hear. For a heartbeat the room was only breathing and the thud of blood in my ears.
Then it was over.
He rolled away, peeled the condom, knotted it, tossed it. No hesitation. No second kiss. He stood, grabbed a couple of tissues from the box I keep on my desk. He wiped me clean, and tossed them in the trashcan as well. Then he pulled on his joggers and hoodie, slid his phone into his pocket like this was just another thing between sets. 
“Later,” he said, as casual as if we’d finished a workout.
The door clicked behind him.
I lay there staring at the ceiling, heart still galloping, skin still hot where he’d held me. My pillow smelled like his soap. I tried to grab onto a thought that made sense and came up empty. It felt good—better than good—and that made it worse. Was this real? Was it just sex?
I didn’t know. I only knew I wanted to hear that knock again.

***

It was Tuesday afternoon after class, the library’s group room had glass walls and a heavy door that never fully shut. You could still hear the hum outside—printers, shoes on carpet, someone coughing down the hall. Tyler had grabbed the corner table. Luis was already there, calculator out like a weapon. I dropped my textbook and notebook and slid into the chair across from them.
“Practice set?” Tyler asked.
“Yeah.” I flipped to the right chapter and spread my loose-leaf. “Let’s knock it out.”
We settled fast—highlighters, pens, a pile of sticky notes. Mia from stats slipped in a minute later, breath a little quick from the stairs, hair clipped up, sweater sleeves pushed to her forearms.
“Sorry,” she said, dropping into the seat next to me. “Printer war.”
“You won,” Tyler said.
She hooked the textbook with two fingers. I kept a hand on the edge and nudged it back toward the middle.
“Share,” she said.
“I’m sharing,” I said. “Equitable distribution.”
She rolled her eyes, smiling, and angled it so we both could see.
We started with the easy problems. I worked steps out loud; Luis tried to skip to the answer key; Tyler punched numbers and called them out. I wrote clean lines in my notebook and pushed it forward for checkpoints.
Mia leaned closer, reading as I went. “Your handwriting is stupidly neat,” she said, low and kind of teasing. “Show-off.”
“Can’t help it,” I said.
She circled my final answer and wrote “yes” next to it, then added a small heart beside the word and smiled at me.

We fell into a rhythm. Tyler took a water break and came back with a stack of the free ones from the front desk. He set one by my elbow.
“Hydrate, king,” he said.
“Thanks, Mom.”
On a longer proof, Mia slid her chair an inch closer to see the algebra. Her shoulder almost touched mine. She watched my pencil run through the steps, then tapped the last line.
“Yeah,” she said. “That’s it.”
She stayed close a beat longer. Then she tilted her head and sniffed once, playful.
“You always smell this good when you study?”
“I always smell good. The studying’s optional.”
She laughed. Tyler snorted. Luis didn’t look up.
I clocked it. The flirting. I didn’t push it. I kept it friendly. She was cute, but right now I wasn’t feeling it. I was thinking of someone else.

We kept moving. She flipped pages back and forth and dragged the book my way; I tugged it back, light, like a game. Luis argued with the back-of-the-book rounding and Tyler told him no one cared from three decimals to two. I rewrote one solution slower for Tyler and boxed the result.
By six, the sun from the hallway had shifted and put a stripe of light across our table. We finished the last problem, checked the section answers, and split topics for next time. I made a quick list of what I’d cover and tore the page out for the group.
Mia capped her pen and sat back. “You’re weirdly organized for a frat guy,” she said.
“Don’t stereotype me,” I said. “I’m more complex than that.”
“Well you definitely have that frat guy body,” she said as she squeezed my bicep. She looked me right in the eye and bit her lower lip.
“OK, we’re gonna go,” said Tyler, catching her vibe.
“I have to go too,” I said, stepping away from Mia. A frown masked her face for a second before it went back to her usual happy smile.
Chairs scraped. We stacked our stuff. I closed my notebook and slid my textbook into my backpack. Luis pocketed his calculator as if it was contraband. Tyler did a lazy fist-bump around the table.
“Same time next week?” Mia asked.
“Works for me,” I said.
“Cool.”
She stood and adjusted her tote strap. She gave me a quick smile—soft, nothing extra. Not an invitation. Just a you’re fine.
“See you,” I said.
We filed out into the main stacks. The room noise felt louder after the quiet. I headed for the stairs with that good, steady feeling you get when you actually get work done. I felt noticed. Normal. Like a student, not just a frat guy.
The other thing was still there under it. Grayson. But for a couple of hours, it had been quiet.

A week later the house was back to full volume. Bass in the floorboards. Red cups on every flat surface. Someone had left the dumb cowboy lights up from Rodeo Night and no one bothered to take them down.
I moved with Tom and Donovan through the living room—trash talk at the pong table, stealing chips, getting dragged into flip cup. Easy night. Laughs came fast.
Grayson was around at first. Clean white tee, dark jeans, backwards cap. He leaned on the island like it belonged to him, trading jabs with Craig and James.
“You up next?” Tom asked him.
“Nah, let Craig miss for me,” Grayson said, tapping his cup.
“Rude,” he said, and made the shot. The table cheered like it mattered.
A group of girls drifted in and Grayson shifted with them. One took his cap and put it on her own head. Another tugged his sleeve. He smiled and let it happen. Enjoying the admiration.

I talked with a couple of girls near the speakers. First-years who wanted to know if the mechanical bull was coming back. I joked that the insurance company said no. They laughed and moved on. I didn’t push anything.
Tyler found me by the kitchen. “You on cup duty later?”
“I already did a round,” I said. “Donovan owes the next one.”
“Facts,” Donovan said, pointing his thumb at himself. “Also, never let Craig pour.”
We messed around for a while longer. I was relaxed. No edge.

Mia showed up by the back door with two friends. Hair down. Black dress this time. She spotted me and came over, hand warm on my forearm.
“Evan,” she said. “You clean up.”
“Thanks. You too.”
“Dance with me,” she said, already tugging.
I let her pull me in. We found space near the edge of the crowd. She moved well. I kept it light—hands brief at her hips, then back to safe. She rose on her toes, mouth near my ear over the music.
“You live close, right?” she said. “Your dorm?”
“Five minutes,” I said.
Her hand landed on my chest. “Convenient.”
She continued the small talk, always finding a reason to put a hand on me. Nothing aggressive. Nothing uncomfortable, just there. I didn’t flirt back. We stayed for another song. She leaned in again, voice softer. “It’s loud in here. We could go somewhere quieter.”
She was cute. I knew what she wanted. This would’ve been easy. A month ago, I wouldn’t have hesitated. I would have had a big smile on my face and brought her back to my room to fuck her. But not tonight. Things have changed, I have changed and I wasn’t interested in a quick hook-up. At least not with her.
I glanced toward the kitchen. “I told Tom I’d help with cleanup before I bounce,” I said. “So I can’t leave the party tonight, sorry.”
She searched my face for a second, then smiled. “Okay then, maybe some other time.”
I walked her back to her friends. “You good?”
“I’m good,” she said, squeezing my wrist once before she let go.

It was getting late and the party was dying down. Fewer people, less noise. I went back to the kitchen where most of the brothers were. Tom and Donovan were stacking remaining cups.
“Prez clocking out with a plus-one again,” Craig said, then corrected himself, “plus-two. As usual.” We all turned and watched as Grayson made his way up the stairs with two good looking girls.
“Man’s consistent,” James said.
I nodded and sipped. That’s how it was.
I grabbed a trash bag from under the sink and did a loop—cups, plates, a slice of pizza face-down on the rug. Donovan held the bag open. Tom wiped a spill on the island.
“Thanks, boys,” Craig said, tossing me another bag.
“No worries,” I said.
By three the place looked less wrecked. I tied off the bag and set it by the back door. I told the guys I was heading out and got a couple of tired fist bumps.
I slipped out the front. The air was cool. Campus was mostly quiet except for a skateboard somewhere and a burst of laughter down the block. I took the long route past the quad. I didn’t text anyone.
I walked home alone. I felt less confused about what I wanted.

***

Two weeks after the party, close to midnight, my phone buzzed.
 Grayson: Come to my room.
I stared at it for a second, then grabbed a hoodie and slipped out. The house was mostly dark. A TV light could be seen on the second floor. I took the side stairs. No one in the hall. His door was cracked.
I knocked once and went in.
He was at his desk in a black tee and sweats, feet bare, phone face down. He looked up and grinned.
“No girl tonight?” I asked, throwing a spike.
“Why would I need a girl when I have you?” he said, and it landed low in me. My chest got tight in a good way. I kept my face straight.
He crossed the room and kissed me. Warm, sure. No rush. His hand cupped the back of my neck and I let myself lean into it. He tasted good. I kissed him back. He smiled against my mouth and walked me backward until my calves hit the bed. I tugged his tee up and off. He pulled at my hoodie, then my shirt, then my joggers, steady and sure, and I let him.
He pushed me back onto the bed and came over me—not heavy, just there. His palm slid down my stomach and wrapped me. He stroked me slow until I was breathing hard, then he dipped his head and took me in. Heat. Wet. He didn’t rush. He set a pace that made my hips twitch and then stilled them with a hand to my thigh. I threaded my fingers through his hair and exhaled a shaky, “Yeah.”

He pulled off with a soft sound and came up to kiss me again. I was buzzing. More sure than the first times. I rolled him onto his back and took off his clothes. His massive cock, already hard slapping against his cut abs. I took my time—hand at the base, tongue under the head, slow seal of my mouth, a little deeper each pass. He was thick and I worked for it. He looked down once, eyes darker than the room, then let his head fall back.
“Oh fuck yes,” he said, voice more like a grumble. His hands tightened in my hair.
I found a rhythm and kept it. Breathe. Sink. Pull back with my tongue dragging. My jaw ached and I didn’t care. His abs jumped under my palm. He said my name once, quiet, like a slip.
His hand touched my shoulder. A nudge. “Come sit on my face,” he murmured.
I blinked, heat crawling up my neck, then moved. I straddled him, careful, and he lifted his chin and got to me. His mouth was soft and greedy at the same time. I bent back to him and took him in again and we found it together—messy, slow, good. His breath was loud against me. Mine was louder.
When I was shaking, he eased me off and sat up, kissing me until the room steadied. He reached into the drawer, tore a condom, rolled it on. Lube next—cool, then warm under his fingers. He was patient. I nodded and turned.
He came in behind me, hands at my hips. The first push stretched me wide and I gripped the sheets and breathed through it. Then the slide—deep and heavy and right. He set a slow pace and stayed with it. My breath came in broken pieces. Every drive landed low and pulled a sound out of me I didn’t plan. I pushed back without thinking and he met me there. Heat flooded my legs. Pressure built. I liked the way he filled me. I liked the drag. I liked how simple my head got.
He leaned over me and kissed my shoulder, then my neck. “Turn,” he said, soft.
He slipped out, I rolled, and he pulled me up and in. Missionary. Close. He pressed into me again and held, our chests touching, his breath against my mouth. He watched my face like he wanted to see every part of it. I cupped his jaw and kissed him and felt him kiss me back like he didn’t want space to open up. He moved again—deeper now, slower, sure. The bed gave a quiet complaint under us. I wrapped my legs around him and kept him close. The closeness did something the position behind me couldn’t. It felt like being chosen while being used well. My hands slid down his back to his waist and held.
I came first, hard, between us. It rolled through me and left me shaking. He steadied me with a hand at the back of my neck and didn’t look away. He kissed me once more, set his hips, and finished a few breaths later—pressed in, a low sound in his throat, still.
He stayed there for a beat, both of us breathing. Then he slid out. He grabbed tissues and a towel from the chair and cleaned me up—gentle wipes over my stomach, a quick swipe at my thigh, a quiet “hey” when I flinched at a ticklish spot. He wiped his own chest, balled everything, and hit the trash can.
I sat up and reached for my clothes. “OK, good night,” I said, after getting dressed.
“Wait,” he said.
He hooked his sweats from the floor and pulled them on, then came over. He took my hip, tilted my face, and kissed me—gentle, lingering. Not a demand. A good night.
“Good night,” he said.
“Night,” I said, softer than I meant to.
I left by the side stair. The hallway was empty. Outside, the campus lights made clean pools on the walk. My legs felt light and unsteady at the same time all the way back to my dorm.
I was sure for now. I didn’t just like him. I wanted him.
