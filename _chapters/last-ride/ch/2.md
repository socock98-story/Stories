I woke up slowly, head pounding, body sore, and for a second I couldn’t remember where I was. I felt something stir beside me, and everything came rushing back. My heart thudded. Grayson’s room, him inside me. Me cumming like I had never come before. I shook those thoughts out of my head as I felt Grayson getting up.


I was on my side, fully naked, sheets twisted around my legs. My body ached—in a good way, mostly—but everything felt too quiet. I turned my head. Grayson was stretching by the window, half-facing me, completely naked and unbothered. His big meaty penis hung soft between his strong thighs. I still couldn’t believe it had been inside me, and it had felt so … good. I shoved the thought away. 
No. I wasn’t like that.


I got up and started grabbing my clothes that had fallen off the bed. He looked at me, like he’d just remembered that I was there. To him, I must have been forgettable, just another person in his bed. It didn’t mean anything.

“You were great last night,” he said. 
I blinked. My face went hot. I didn’t know what to say. Maybe it wasn’t just me who thought last night was good.
But then he added, “We ended up first, and won the tournament. We managed to save my honor as president.”
My stomach twisted. I nodded quickly, eyes on the floor. “Yeah. That was cool.”
I didn’t know why I felt hurt that his comments weren’t directed at my sexual prowess. 
I’m straight. Why would I care if a guy thought I was good in bed?

I put on my clothes as fast as I could. I just needed to get out. “I gotta go,” I mumbled.
“Bye,” he said, without even looking up from his phone.

I let myself out without another word, and made my way to my dorm, using the side passage from last night, hoping nobody would see me.

—

I pushed into my dorm room, the door clicking shut behind me. Small space, barely enough for two guys, though for now I had it to myself. My roommate had dropped out after two weeks, and they didn’t assign anyone else to the room. The beds were still set up on opposite sides, twin XLs with thin mattresses that groaned if you moved too fast. One narrow window let in pale morning light, not enough to fight the headache behind my eyes. Desk, chair, a couple drawers. It wasn’t much, but it was private. Just your typical college dorm room. I kicked off my shoes and grabbed my towel. I needed a shower. Badly.


The communal showers were almost empty, only one other stall was in use. I made my way to the one opposite and pulled the curtains behind me. The water took a second to heat up. I leaned against the wall, hands flat. When it turned hot, it felt good. Too good. Like it was washing away the memories of last night.
Grayson’s mouth flashed in my mind. His hands on my hips. The way he—
My cock twitched. I gritted my teeth. I was getting hard again. My hand found myself, almost on instinct. A few quick strokes.
I stopped. Let the water pound my back. 
“Just the alcohol. Just the heat of the moment,” I thought. “I am straight. It didn’t mean anything. Everybody experiments in college.”


I quickly finished cleaning myself up. I tied my towel around my waist and went back to my room. I had to hurry back to the frat house. After all, it was the duty of a pledge to clean up after a party.



When I arrived at the house, a couple of other pledges were already there, cleaning, and I joined Tom in the backyard. He was paired with James the night before, and they finished second, just behind Grayson and I. We were throwing trash, mostly plastic cups, into big black garbage bags.


“I really thought we had the win in the bag,” said Tom to me. “I still can’t believe you beat us.”
“Yeah, well, the best team won,” I teased him. 
“Got to admit, that bull ride was impressive. I was looking at you and you looked like…”
I crushed the plastic cup I was holding. My hands clenched in panic as he paused to find his words. Did he notice I was grinding on Grayson? 
“Like you really wanted to win,” he finally resumed, after what felt like the longest second of my life. “I don’t know how to say it, but you looked like you were holding on to the bull like your life depended on it.”
I breathed, and relaxed. He didn’t know. Nobody knew.
“We needed to beat you. And we did,” I said, going back to my usual self.
“Just luck! You were with Grayson, next time I’ll beat you.”

We laughed and chatted a bit more as we finished cleaning the backyard. He told me about his night, how he bonded with James and struck out with girls. I, on the other hand, remained pretty vague about my relationship with Grayson. And when asked if I got lucky, I simply said that I didn’t bring any girl back to my dorm, which technically was the truth.


Once we were done with the backyard, we moved back inside, to help the others. While the backyard was pretty big, inside the house we also had to vacuum and clean every room on the first floor. Every pledge was working hard, still visibly exhausted from the party. A small group of frat brothers, including Grayson, were having coffee around the kitchen aisle, watching the pledges clean. Most of them were wearing shorts, tank tops and backwards caps with the frat logo on it. Grayson was wearing just shorts, exposing his incredibly sculpted abs to the kitchen lights.
I didn’t look at them. I tried to make myself invisible, to not be noticed by our frat president. But it failed because Craig called me over. I offered a weak hello as I walked up to them, and once again Grayson didn’t even spare a glance at me, only drinking his coffee and looking at his phone.


“Congrats on your win last night, pledge!” shouted Craig. He always spoke loudly.
“Thanks,” I said, scratching the back of my head.
“By the way, where were you two last night?” he asked. “We couldn’t even celebrate your win!”
I felt my face go hot. I didn’t know how to answer that question. I didn’t want to tell the truth–that I was getting rear-ended by Grayson while they continued the party.
“Well I know where you were, Gray,” he said, looking at Grayson who finally looked up from his phone, a questioning look on his face. “I went to your room to see if you were there, and heard the typical screams of pleasure coming from it, so I went back downstairs. I just don’t know who you were with.”
“I don’t kiss and tell,” told Grayson, sipping his coffee. I guessed it was too embarrassing for him to admit he was with me.
“You never do,” intervened Damian, one of the other frat brothers present in the kitchen. His comment made everyone but Grayson erupt in laughter. I followed with a nervous laugh, rather than a real one. 
Craig stared at me, waiting for me to explain where I had gone after the mechanical bull. I panicked, I couldn’t think of a convincing lie. I looked at Grayson and he looked back at me. Indifferent. Like the night before hadn’t happened. But then he spoke: “Evan drank too much, so I sent him back to his dorms.”
Another round of laughter started from Craig, it seemed Grayson’s lie had satisfied them. 
“Can’t handle your booze, pledge?” he asked. 
“We’ll have to fix that!” he added before I could reply. “Anyway, you won last night so you don’t have to clean up, you can hang out with us.”
“It’s OK, cleaning after a party is the duty of a pledge,” I said, rejecting Craig’s offer. “I’m gonna help my brothers.”


What followed were a few seconds of cold silence. It felt like I was passing an interview and was awaiting the results of it. Maybe I shouldn’t have refused to hang out with them. They might think it was rude of me. But my worries melted when I saw a big smile appear on Craig’s face.
“Wow, pledge! I’m impressed, you’re loyal to your brothers!” he said, as he slapped my shoulder with enthusiasm. “We like that in a pledge, don’t we Gray?”
“Yes, we do,” confirmed Grayson. He was looking right into my eyes. His expression was different this time, it made me shiver. I couldn’t tell what he was thinking.


I rapidly made my way back to the other pledges, ready to help them clean.
“Respect, Evan!” said Donovan, another pledge, as he high-fived me. “If I was told I could slack off, I would have. But not you, you’re a real bro. I’m impressed, man.”
All the other pledges nodded at me with respect, and I nodded back. They had all heard my conversation with Craig and were impressed with my decision to help them clean. I soaked it in for a second, keeping to myself the real reason why I had refused Craig’s offer. I simply didn’t want to hang out with Grayson.


As we cleaned, we could feel the brothers' eyes on us from the kitchen. They would tease and give us instructions like “You missed a spot there!”. The mood in the house was good.
A few minutes later, I heard Grayson say: “Alright, I’mma head to the gym, later.”
He walked right by me as I was cleaning and he didn’t even glance at me. That made it clear. The previous night meant nothing, and I should get it out of my head.


I pushed the thought down and focused on the work. The house wasn’t going to clean itself. And maybe, after today, things would go back to how they were.

I was back at the frat house. A week after Rodeo Night, and the place already felt normal again. Another party. Smaller this time—just drinks, music, flirting. Nothing special.

The house was packed, though. Half the campus probably knew when Alpha Rho threw a party. The bass thumped through the floorboards. People danced in the living room, red solo cups everywhere. The kitchen smelled like beer and pizza. I grabbed a beer from one of the coolers and made my way through the crowd.
A few of the other pledges were hanging out near the back porch. Tom spotted me. “Yo, Evan! Ready to party?”
 “Yes,” I shouted, clinking cups with him. We joked around for a while, some frat brothers came by, handed out shots, and the night started to blur in that good way parties do when you’ve had enough to drink.


Now and then, out of the corner of my eye, I’d spot Grayson. Not that I was looking. But come on—he stood out. Always did. Shirt tight around his chest, girls hanging on him like he was some celebrity. I took another sip and turned back to my friends. He could do what he wanted. I was here to have a good time.
After a while, a girl caught my eye. Blonde, light blue dress. Cute smile. We kept ending up near each other on the dance floor, laughing at the same dumb stuff. I brought her a drink, and from then on, we pretty much stuck together.
I wasn’t much of a dancer, but she was. We kept ending up close, her moving with the beat, me trying to follow. When I was off, she laughed and pulled me closer, guiding my rhythm. From this distance, she could feel my toned body and complimented me on it. I tried to play it cool, saying “This is nothing.” But deep down I was happy she recognized the efforts I had put in. 


Later in the night, after the crowd had thinned out, I spotted Grayson again. He was heading towards the stairs, smiling, two girls at his side. I felt a twist in my stomach, maybe I had done one too many shots. After all, he could fuck whoever he wanted. I didn’t care. I could too.
I looked down at my dance partner, and hesitated for a second. She was really pretty, with her blue eyes that matched her dress.
“I don’t know if this is too forward, but do you want to go back to my dorm?” I finally asked. “I don’t have a roommate so we’ll have the room to ourselves.” I tried to sound confident but I could feel a drop of sweat dribble down my back.
She smiled. “I didn’t know how many more times I had to touch your biceps before you asked.” I smiled back at her.
I opened the door for her as we left the party. We walked side by side, laughing about a crazy professor we had in common as we made our way back to my room.

***

She was pulling her dress back on while I grabbed my boxer briefs from the floor. I offered to let her stay, even sleep in the other bed, but she smiled and said she’d rather head back to her room. She said she didn’t want to be caught in the walk of shame.
“Sleeping with me is shameful?” I asked, feigning being hurt.
“No! But you don’t know girls,” she immediately replied. “We’re so judgy.”
I walked up to the door, wearing only my underwear, to open it up for her. “I could put on some clothes and walk you back to your dorm.”
“You’re so nice,” she said as she put her hand on my bare chest. “But I’ll find my way on my own.”
For a second I wondered if she’d faked it and was now trying to get away from me. But then she smiled, as if reading my thoughts. “I’m not rushing because of you. You were great. Better than great even. This was just a hook-up. But I know where to find you.”
I smiled. She gave me a quick peck on the lips and I watched her walk away before closing the door. I laid down on my bed and stared at the ceiling. She was hot, and it felt good. 
Just not as good as him.

A few weeks later, most of us pledges had made it through. Eight of us had started, six were now full brothers, including Tom and Donovan. The night of our initiation was a blur — part ceremony, part party, all of us drunk by the end of it.
I’d been spending more time with the other brothers — beers after class, pickup games, late-night bullshit in the lounge. But with Grayson, it was still... the same. Group stuff only. No one-on-one. Not since that night. And I was fine with that. We weren’t close friends, we weren’t anything really.


Until one Thursday night, I was in my dorm, watching a TV show in my underwear, when I received a simple text from him: “Come to my room.” Nothing else.
No explanations, no question mark. Just a simple order. I felt a drop of sweat trickle down my face as I tried to figure out what this could mean. He hadn’t acknowledged me at all since our night together, so why now. It couldn’t be that he wanted to do this–not again…
I debated if I should go or not, but this was an order from the frat president. As a frat member, I had to go. I picked up some clothes, put my shoes on and made my way to the frat house.



From outside I could see the lights were still on in the living room. It wasn’t that late so it made sense that some of the brothers were still up. I checked and nobody was outside, nor seemed to be looking outside, so I took my chance and sneaked in to the side of the house. The old servant’s door was open–the one we had used on that night. I slowly climbed my way up the stairs, my heartbeat getting faster with each step I took. I reached his door and I paused. My heart felt like it was about to explode, and I could hear a ringing in my head but I pushed through and knocked on his door.

“Come in,” I heard his low voice call from inside.
I opened the door and I froze. I swallowed hard. He was lying on his bed, atop the covers, completely naked and slowly touching his half-hard cock. It already looked massive. 
It felt like I woke up from a trance when I finally stopped looking at his body. I realized he wasn’t even looking at me. He was staring right in front of him, at his flat screen TV mounted on the wall. A straight porn video was playing, with a blonde woman choking on a massive cock. I closed the door behind me and stood still in front of it.
“Took you long enough,” he finally said, still not looking at me.
“What’s going on? Did you strike out or something?” I asked, laughing nervously.
He shut down the TV and looked me dead in the eyes. “You of all people should know I don’t strike out. If I want someone, I fuck them.”
I fell silent. His green eyes peered deep into my soul. I was starting to feel uncomfortable, not because of him, but because I was starting to get aroused.
“What am I doing here?” I asked him.
“You know exactly why you’re here.”
“I’m straight,” I blurted. I knew what he wanted, and although deep down I wanted it too, I wasn’t ready to admit it just yet. “I don’t do that.” He chuckled.
“You knew exactly why I called you here, and you came. So stop pretending and get to it.” He punctuated his last sentence by grabbing his, now, hard cock. I didn’t say anything. My mouth was dry, and I couldn’t meet his gaze. Then my legs moved on their own. I took my place between his legs and immediately took his head in my mouth.

“Good boy,” he complimented and I shivered.

He was still too big for me to take all of him in, so I focused my efforts on the first few inches. Swirling my tongue around the head. Bobbing up and down on his length. I was really getting his shaft wet. But it didn’t seem to be enough for him as he grabbed my hair and pushed me down. I gagged on his cock, tears forming in my eyes.
“Come on, Evan. You’re not a pledge anymore, you can do better than that.”
I tried to relax my throat, and it helped. I took more of him in, but I still couldn’t take it all. That’s how thick it was. Thankfully, he didn’t try to push me further than I could go. But he still kept his hand on my head and was dictating the rhythm. I did my best to please him, and it seemed to be working because at times he would let a low groan slip out. 

He pulled my head up from his crotch and said: “Get on all fours.”
I immediately obeyed. I heard the sound of a condom wrapper being torn open. Then I felt him spit on my hole, spread my cheeks and pushed himself in. I groaned as the burn hit me with every inch.
“That’s it, take it all,” he encouraged me.
When he was all in, he didn’t wait for a second. He pulled himself out completely before slamming all of it back in. I felt the air leaving my lungs, and I couldn’t make a sound anymore. That’s when the pounding started. He kept ramming his big cock as deep as he could inside me. Giving me no mercy. Not that I asked for any. Without touching it, my own cock was fully hard. My whole body was on fire–in a good way. He was giving it to me hard, but it was the best thing I had ever received.

At one point he pushed me down on the bed. And he got even rougher. Fucking me with even longer, and harder thrusts. I was screaming with pleasure into the mattress. Biting the covers in an attempt to keep myself silent. He was just as loud as me, moaning “Oh fuck”, ”Feels amazing”, ”Fucking take it” with almost every slam.


I couldn’t tell you how long it lasted. I lost track of how many times I came. I was on a cloud of pleasure and I didn’t want to go back down. But all good things must come to an end. He pushed deep inside me one last time and filled the condom.

“Fuuuuck!!” he moaned as he orgasmed.

After a minute, he pulled out of me and rolled onto his bed. 
“What a hole, incredible.”
One minute I was in heaven. The next, I was lying there, naked, with the weight of what just happened crashing back in. I’d just been fucked by my frat president.
I was conflicted. It felt good—better than good—but I wasn’t attracted to men.
I looked over at him. He was staring at the ceiling, unbothered. He looked handsome, no doubt about that. Clean-cut abs, thick chest, and a cock that would make most guys jealous. It was still hard, slick with spit and cum.
For a second, the word “delicious” flashed through my brain. I shook it off before it stuck.


I put my clothes on, Grayson barely noticing me and I walked out of the room without a word. 
I might not be as straight as I thought. I needed to figure it out.
