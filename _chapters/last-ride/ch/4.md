It had been over a month since I realized I liked Grayson, and not much had changed.
I was deeper in the house now. Craig looped me into planning—theme ideas, budget spreadsheets, who was on door duty, who ran the playlist, who bought ice. I did Costco runs, booked the speaker rental, fixed a busted CO₂ line once with YouTube and a prayer. Guys called me when the cups ran out or when the DJ bailed. I had a usual spot in the lounge and a key to the storage closet. It felt good. Like I actually belonged.
With Grayson, things… shifted a notch. We were friends now. I guess better friends than he was with the other new recruits. He’d talk to me in the house when it was just the two of us, text me about non-frat-related things. The late knocks didn’t stop; they happened more. A few times a week, easy. Sometimes he called. Sometimes he just appeared. It always felt great; he always left right after. We didn’t talk about it, didn’t define it. We had sex. It felt good. It seemed enough for him.
But there were moments where I wondered:
— we were in the kitchen corner and he gave me a quick kiss, the fridge hum loud in the quiet; we broke apart at footsteps and he handed me a Gatorade like that was why he came in.
— movie night with half the house: two couches pushed together; our knees touched under the blanket; his thumb traced once above my knee and stayed.
— we bumped into each other on campus between classes: his hand found the small of my back and steered me through like it was second nature.
— gym: I spotted him; he racked the bar and said “good set” low, then squeezed my shoulder on the way past.
— he tossed me his hoodie after a backyard clean-up; I wore it home; it never made it back; he didn’t ask.

Sex tilted slower most nights. More kissing. More eye contact. He watched my face like he was learning it. On other nights he took me apart fast and I let my brain turn off. Either way, I slept better after.
I hadn’t seen him walk off with a girl lately. Maybe I wasn’t paying attention anymore. Either way, I knew what I was. A hook-up. A regular one, sure. Maybe a friend. I wanted more. And even with the small changes—the texts, the food runs, the casual daytime ease—we weren’t there yet. Not where I wanted it to be. But I wasn’t going to bring it up first.

***

He was close. I could feel it in the way his hips tightened, in the sound he made against my neck. Two more deep drives and I broke first, clenching around him as I came hard onto my stomach. He groaned, held in, pulsed into the condom, and went still.
We rolled apart, shoulder to shoulder, chests heaving. I slid in, cheek to his chest for a second. He threw an arm around me without thinking. Warm. Solid. It fit too well.
I pulled away before I sank into it. He slid out and tied off. I wiped down, tossed the tissues, and started getting dressed—boxers, joggers, shirt—hands moving so my head didn’t.
Grayson stood and pulled on his sweats. He didn’t leave. He stepped in close, pressed me back against my desk, and kissed me. Slow, deep. His hand slid up my ribs; his thumb found that spot that made my knees loosen.
“God, you’re good,” he said against my mouth. “Every time.” Another kiss. “You make me cum like nobody else.” Another. It felt so tender, so affectionate. I couldn’t stand it anymore.
I kissed him back for a beat—too easy to fall. I put a hand on his chest and held him off an inch.
“Hookups don’t kiss like that,” I said.
He blinked. The smile stayed, smaller. “We always kiss.”
“Not like that,” I said. My throat felt tight. “This isn’t just fun for me. I like you, Grayson.” 

He looked at me for a long second, like he was testing words in his head and rejecting all of them. He exhaled through his nose and stepped back half a step. “What do you mean?”

“I think I might be bisexual. I’m attracted to you. I like you. I want to be with you. I want more.”

“Dating isn’t me,” he said. “I just want to have fun.”

It landed dull and hard. I nodded once. Stepped sideways out of his space.
“Then this is over,” I said. “Because I want more than fun. Don’t text me. Don’t come over. We’ll just be frat brothers.”
“Evan—”
“I’m serious.” My voice wobbled. I hated that it wobbled.
Something flashed in his face—annoyance, then something else. He set his jaw.
“Fine,” he said.
He grabbed his hoodie, opened the door, and left. The room went too quiet. I pressed my palms to the desk and stared at the scratch in the wood. My eyes burned. I swiped at them and told myself I meant it.

A minute passed before the handle clicked. The door swung back open hard. No knock. He came in fast, shut it, crossed the room, and kissed me harder than he ever had. Like his lips couldn’t not be on mine.
“I hate you,” he said, forehead to mine. “I hate how you’re making me feel, because this isn’t me.” His voice was rough in a way I hadn’t heard. “But I can’t stop thinking about you. I can’t stay away from you.”
“You want more too?”
“...Yes,” he whispered.
My heart hammered. “Does that mean you’re my—”
“Yes,” he said, quick, like it might escape.
“You have to say it,” I said.
He grimaced like I’d made him do burpees. “Don’t make me say it.”
“Say it.”
He swallowed. “You’re my boyfriend.”
Heat rushed through me. It hit every place his hands had been. I kissed him, fast. My hands went all over his body, not knowing what to do but to try to take him all in.
“Fuck me,” I said. It came out like a need.
We fumbled each other’s clothes without breaking the kiss—his hoodie to the chair, my shirt to the floor. He backed me to the bed, naked again. I reached into the drawer and came up with a condom. He took it, looked at it and said, “We’re going to have to go to the student clinic because there can’t be anything between boyfriends. Besides, I’ll have to fill you up to claim you as mine.” I nodded.

He kissed me as he rolled the condom on, one hand steady at my hip. I pulled him down and he pushed inside slow, watching my face. The stretch hit, then eased, and I let out a breath I didn’t know I was holding. He stayed close—chest to chest, mouth near mine—moving careful, like we had time.
“Good?” he asked, quiet.
“Yeah,” I said. “Yeah.”
It felt different with the word in my head. Boyfriend. Same bodies, same bed, but it hit warmer. He kept the pace and kissed me in between breaths, not rushing the kiss or the thrusts. I slid my hands over his shoulders, down his back, learned the lines again, then lower to his waist to pull him deeper. He gave it to me and smiled against my mouth like he liked being asked.
“Let me,” I said, and nudged his shoulder.
He eased out and I rolled him onto his back. I climbed over him, took him in again slow, and sank down until I was full. His hands came to my hips and just rested there. No pushing, just a hold. I set the rhythm I could keep, rocking more than bouncing, rolling my hips to find the spot that made heat climb my spine. His eyes never left mine. When I shivered, he brushed a thumb over my stomach and I swore, breath breaking. I rode him a little harder and it happened fast—pressure, spark, then I was spilling across his abs with a sound I couldn’t swallow.
He caught my wrist and pulled me down to kiss me through it. I shook and laughed once into his mouth without meaning to. He kissed that, too.
He sat up and wrapped an arm around my back, then shifted us to our sides. He stayed inside me, spooned up behind me, and the change felt intimate in a way I hadn’t expected—his chest on my back, his breath at my ear, one arm under my head like a pillow. He moved slow from there, deep, unhurried. His free hand slid down and wrapped me. He stroked me lazy while he worked his hips and my brain went bright and blank again.
He kissed my neck and set his hips, deeper now, steady. I moaned from the long strokes. “I’ve got you,” he whispered into my ear and that was all I needed. I came a second time, quieter, clenching around him, and felt him groan into my neck. I felt him pulse with a quiet “Fuck.” We were done. It was the same before, yet, somehow it felt infinitely better. 
He stayed behind me, breathing hard. Sweat cooled between us, I could count his abs on my back. He kissed me—soft, a few small pecks—then slipped out and tied off. He grabbed tissues and a towel, cleaned me up first with gentle wipes, then himself, tossed everything, and came back to the bed.
I pulled the sheet up and he lay on his side facing me. We kissed again, slow, a little sloppy from being tired. After a minute he shifted like he was about to stand.
“Where are you going?” I asked, catching his wrist. “Boyfriends spend the night.”
He paused, then smiled like he’d just remembered. “Right. Not used to it just yet.”
He slid back in, kissed me once more, then tucked in behind me, arm around my middle. I sank into it and let my eyes close with his breath warm at the back of my neck.

I woke up first to light pushing around the edges of the shade. For a second I didn’t move. His arm was still over me, heavy and comfortable. I rolled carefully to face him.
He looked stupidly handsome asleep. Lashes too long for a guy, mouth soft, the kind of relaxed you never saw when he was on. A tiny crease at his brow smoothed when I brushed a thumb near it. He blinked awake and focused on me.
“Good morning,” he said, voice rough. He leaned in and kissed me, slow, a little smile in it.
“Morning,” I said.
He kept looking at me like he was lining up a thought. “About last night.”
My stomach dipped. “You’re having second thoughts?”
“No.” He shook his head once. “I’m just not ready to be out yet.”
“Oh,” I said, and the relief hit fast. “Yeah. Me neither.”
“Let’s keep it between us for now,” he said. “At least while we’re still figuring it out.”
“Okay,” I said. “We’ll be careful.”
We talked logistics—side stair always, no texts that read like more than they are, no sleeping over when the floor’s busy, no getting sloppy at parties. He groaned at the last one and I laughed.
He glanced at the time on his phone and winced. “I need to grab clothes,” he said. “I’ll come by later.”
He sat up, then leaned back over me, cupped my cheeks in both hands, and kissed me deep. No rush, all in. When he pulled back, he rested his forehead to mine for a second, then stood, grabbed his hoodie, and headed for the door.
“See you,” he said, a half-smile on his lips.
“See you,” I said.
The door clicked shut. I stared at it and felt that warm, unreal float in my chest. I lay back and grinned into my pillow like an idiot.
My boyfriend. It felt nice to think.

***

My phone buzzed close to eleven.
Grayson: Come over.
I stared at it. We’d made it official yesterday morning and all he could say to see me was “Come over”? No “hey,” no emoji, no nothing. I grabbed my hoodie anyway and took the side stair.
His door was cracked. I pushed in. Grayson looked up from the TV, already smiling, and stepped in to kiss me. I slid my head aside and he paused, brows up.
“Something wrong?”
“‘Come over,’” I said.
He tilted his head. “What about it?”
“That’s how you say it?”
“That’s how we’ve always done.”
“Yeah, but our relationship changed,” I said, dropping into his desk chair. “We’re boyfriends now. I’m not your pledge, not your hook-up. You can’t order me around anymore.”
“Oh, you won’t do everything I say?” he said, mock-wounded, brushing a finger along my cheek.
“I’m serious, Gray.”
“I know, babe.” The way he said it was soft, not a tease. “I didn’t mean anything by it. I’ll be more mindful. I don’t think of myself as your boss.”
“Babe?” I repeated.
“Yeah. You don’t like it? I can call you something else.”
“No—babe is great… babe,” I said, heat crawling up my neck. 
He grinned and kissed me. Quick, warm. “But no more ordering me around for a hook-up.”
He snorted. “Now who doesn’t know things have changed. I didn’t ask you to come here for sex.” Then he nodded at the TV. 
“Then why?”
“To hang out,” he said. “Movie?”
“Okay. Cool.”
We stretched out on his bed, me tucked in under his arm, my face against his neck. He flicked through menus.
“What do you want to watch?”
“Have you seen Redline Protocol?” I said. “Action thing. Dumb title, good stunts.”
“Haven’t. Let’s do it.”
He queued it up. As the logo spun, he said, “By the way, I went and got tested today.”
“Oh—right. I’ll go tomorrow,” I said. “Should be fine.”
“Yeah. I’m not worried.” He pulled me closer. We let the opening car chase take over.
—
After the credits, I sat up on an elbow. “That was good. You like it?”
“It was all right,” he said. “Action was mid.”
“What? The dam jump? The bit where he parkoured a moving bus?”
He glanced at me, cheeks a little pink. “I guess I was watching something else.”
“What were you watching?”
He didn’t answer. He didn’t have to. I leaned in and kissed him. He kissed back, slower, hand at my jaw. It built from there. Clothes shuffled. The rest didn’t need play-by-play. It was enough that we didn’t hurry.
—
Next afternoon I left the student center with a bandage on my elbow and a paper packet stuffed with too many pamphlets. Blood draw, a couple swabs, the usual questions. I took a handful from the free-condoms bowl out of reflex and laughed at myself on the way out.
The quad was busy. I spotted Mia coming down the path with a coffee. She saw me and waved.
“Hey, stranger,” she said. “You skip stats or did stats skip you?”
“Yeah, I’ve been busy,” I said.
She smiled. “You look good. Less dead-eyed than midterms week.”
“Thanks. You too. New job for the printer yet or still at war?”
“Ceasefire,” she said, lifting the coffee. “Bribery works.”
We walked a few steps together and traded quick class gripes. She nudged my arm with her elbow.
“Well, since you aren’t asking, I have to,” she said. “Do you want to go out sometime?”
“Oh.” I paused, then decided not to be a coward. “Sorry. I’m seeing someone already. It’s pretty new.”
She blinked once, then smiled. “What can you do. A good-looking guy like you—figures.”
“I’m sorry.”
“It’s okay,” she said. “I hope you’ll be happy together.”
“Thanks,” I said. “I’m sure you’ll meet someone great.”
She made a face. “Or at least someone who can do derivatives.” We laughed. She squeezed my arm and peeled off toward the library.
I kept walking with the packet under my arm and the bandage itching a little. I hadn’t said everything. I didn’t need to. Saying something was enough. It felt good to acknowledge it out loud.

***
My results came in during stats. All clear.
I stared at the screen, felt my face go hot, and typed under the desk:
 Me: Tonight? Your room? 10?
 Grayson: Can’t wait ❤️
I smiled like an idiot and shifted in my seat as I felt myself stiffening in my pants. Focusing after that was hard.
—-
At ten I took the side stair. He opened the door before I knocked and pulled me in for a quick hello kiss.
“How was your—”
“I’ve got more important things to talk about,” I said, pulling my phone out. I showed him the email. He’d already sent me his earlier. “Do you know what that means?”
“Bye, bye, condoms,” he said, grinning.
I kissed him hard. He laughed into it. “Not wasting time, huh?”
“Do you want to wait?” I asked, breath short.
He didn’t answer. He kissed me again and tugged my shirt. “Take off all your clothes.”
I did. He did, too. The sight of him still knocked me back—broad chest, cut stomach, that thick curve hanging heavy and already half up. I pushed him into his desk chair and dropped to my knees.
I took him slow at first. Hand at the base, tongue under the head, mouth sealing around him. He sighed, deep in his chest, and let his legs fall open. I worked him—long pulls, then shorter, wetter ones—one hand cupping his balls, rolling them, the other stroking what I couldn’t take. He breathed my name once, quiet. His thighs tensed under my forearms. When he got too close, he touched my cheek.
“Come here,” he said, voice rough.
I stood and he pulled me into a kiss that tasted like him and me. Then he stripped the rest of the way and pushed me back onto the bed. He went down on me like he meant to prove something. No rush, just pressure and patience, tongue heavy, fist snug at the base. I groaned and grabbed for his hair and he hummed like he liked the sound of it.
He slid lower and lifted my hips, spreading me. His mouth was hot where I was never not sensitive. He rimmed me until my legs shook, then reached for the lube in the drawer. Fingers worked me open—one, then two—careful, steady, letting me nod before he slid a third. I breathed through it.
“Fuck me! I need you,” I begged. He chuckled.
“Whatever you want, babe.”
“Turn over,” he said, soft.
I got on my knees. He lined up and pushed in slow, no barrier this time. The heat of it hit hard. Different. Closer. I exhaled into the mattress and pushed back to take the rest.
“Fuck,” he said, low. “You feel insane.”
He held my hips and set a slow rhythm at first, building, hips clapping against me. The stretch turned to a deep, heavy good that traveled up my spine. I met him, hands planted, breath breaking with each drive. He reached under and stroked me in time with the thrusts and I had to bite a gasp down.
He shifted me up onto my knees and wrapped an arm across my chest, pulling me back against him while he stayed inside. New angle, deeper; my head tipped back to his shoulder and I swore into his ear. He kissed the side of my neck and smiled against my skin like he was proud of the sound he’d pulled from me.
“Up,” he said, and lifted me.
My back hit the wall and the cool painted plaster shocked a breath out of me. I wrapped my legs around his waist and locked my ankles; his hands hooked under my thighs and held me there like I weighed nothing. He stayed buried and drove up into me, hard and sure, each thrust bouncing a dull knock out of the drywall. I clung to his shoulders, forearms straining under my knees, the angle brutal and perfect. Heat poured through my hips; the drag of him felt rawer like this—no mattress, no give, just him pinning me and using his strength like it was made for this.
“Look at me,” he said, and I did. His eyes were dark and focused, mouth open, breath rough against my cheek. He kissed me messily between thrusts, then dropped one hand from my thigh and wrapped me, stroking in time with his hips.
He murmured “I want to watch you as I empty inside you,” and kissed me quick, then eased me onto my back. He pushed my knees up and slid in again. Missionary. Close. He braced on his hands and held my eyes, hips rolling in a rhythm that unraveled me all over again. I dragged my nails lightly down his back and he shivered, then dipped to kiss me, slow, like he didn’t want the space between our mouths at all.
He sped up a notch. The slick heat of him, the weight of him, the look he gave me like I was the only thing in the room—it all stacked until I was gone again. Pressure climbed too fast; I gripped his shoulders and gasped. I painted my stomach with my cum.
“Want me to fill you up?” he asked, voice shredded.
“Yes.”
“Say it.”
“I want your load,” I said, and felt my face flush even as the words left.
He groaned, pressed in deep, and I felt him pulse inside me, hot and heavy, emptying into me for the first time. The thought—his cum in me, nothing between us—sent another tremor through my legs.
He didn’t pull out. He kissed me instead, hungry. He followed the trail down and lapped my stomach, came back up and kissed me again, sharing it without asking, messy and filthy and somehow perfect because it was him.
We lay there breathing. He eased out carefully and I felt the warmth slip down, a ridiculous, good reminder. He wiped me with the towel and tossed it aside. I curled into him and he dragged me in tighter, a hand at the back of my head, thumb moving once at my neck.
“Is it me or was that even better than usual?” I said, still panting a little.
He huffed a laugh. “It was fucking amazing.”
I kissed him again, softer, then again, because I could. He kissed me back like we had all night.
And we did.
