I’m pretty sure Dylan’s basement used to be a storage room, but he and his dad turned it into a gaming cave senior year—old couch, two beanbags, a big TV mounted a little crooked, LED strip doing that slow color fade. There’s a fan in the corner that sounds like a plane taking off, but it keeps the sweat down. Someone left a graduation cap on the shelf next to a stack of school hoodies, so yeah, that’s the vibe—summer after, nothing to do but hang out.
We’re mid-match, me and Ryan on co-op, Dylan sprawled on the beanbag doing this deadpan commentator voice every time we whiff a shot. “Evan misses the open net—again,” he says, and I toss a controller at him, not hard, just enough for it to bounce off his thigh.
“Shut up, coach,” I say. “You’re next if we lose.”
“We’re not losing,” Ryan says, leaning forward, elbows on his knees, tongue pressed into his cheek the way he does when he’s too into a game. He taps the trigger like a woodpecker, scores, and throws his arms up. “Boom. You see that? D1 scouts should be calling me just off that move.”
“Yeah, for esports,” I say.
He grins that Ryan grin—cocky but stupid in a friendly way. “Better scholarship than you, Cole.”
Dylan yawns. “Can you two keep it down? My mom thinks we’re studying.”
“For what?” I say.
“For life,” Dylan says, straight face, then smiles a little. Dylan’s like that—quiet humor that doesn’t try too hard.
We run another match, then a couple of rounds of another game, then break without saying we’re breaking. Ryan raids the mini fridge. I scroll on my phone, not really reading anything. Dylan flips a water bottle up and catches it with that neat little hand-eye thing he’s got. The house is quiet upstairs; the basement smells like clean laundry and cheap pizza from earlier.
Ryan comes back with three sports drinks like he’s a sponsor. “So,” he says, dropping onto the couch next to me, “you know Ellie? From the diner?”
I make a face like I need more info.
“Red nails, big laugh, does the milkshake thing with the metal cups? We went by last week.”
“Oh—Ellie,” I say. “Yeah.”
“Ran into her last night,” he says. “At Ash’s bonfire.”
Dylan looks over, amused. “And?”
Ryan shrugs, way too casual. “We talked. She said she likes guys who… can bring it.”
“Bring what?” I ask.
“Pleasure,” he says, and waggles his eyebrows.
I groan. “You are the worst.”
“Hey, I’m just saying,” he goes on. “Some guys talk like they’re all that but then, you know, when it’s go time, they’re like—” He does a sad trombone noise. Dylan actually snorts.
“You’re such a bullshitter,” I say. “You talk big because you’re small.”
“I am not small,” he fires back, immediate. “In any metric.”
Dylan sips, eyes smiling. “He means emotionally.”
“Okay, screw both of you.” Ryan leans back, drapes his arm over the back of the couch and looks at us like he’s about to pitch a business idea. “Real question though: top five girls from our class. Looks and vibe. Go.”
Dylan groans again but he’s still smiling. “You’re so bored.”
“I am not,” Ryan says. “Evan, go.”
We kick names around, half serious, half dumb. It turns into “remember when” stories, prom photos, who dated who, who did the crying at Homecoming. It’s stupid and kind of mean sometimes, but we always pull it back before it gets gross. The fan ticks over to a higher speed. Outside, a lawn mower starts up somewhere, that summer buzz. I stretch my legs and my shorts ride up; I don’t pull them down. Ryan notices and bumps my knee with his. It’s nothing. It’s just how dudes sit when they’ve known each other forever.
Somewhere in there the talk slides from girls to… yeah, sex—like it does when three guys are bored and it’s summer and nobody’s parents are on our case. Ryan’s the one steering, no surprise. He’s clowning on some sophomore rumor about locker room myths, then bringing up that one senior who swore he was “ten easy.” Dylan and I roll our eyes in sync.
“He was not ten,” Dylan says, finally weighing in. “He couldn’t keep his shorts up without a belt. Physics says no.”
“Facts,” I say.
Ryan points at us with his bottle cap. “See, this is why I like you two. We deal in truth.” He pauses, then grins. “Speaking of truth…”
“No,” Dylan says, already suspicious.
“Relax,” Ryan laughs. “It’s not a big deal. We’ve seen each other naked a hundred times in the locker room. Showers. Whatever. And not for nothing, we are the top three of that room. You know it. I know it. Even Coach—actually no, that sounds wrong, forget Coach.”
Dylan covers his face. “Please stop talking.”
“I’m just saying,” Ryan says, smirking. “Soft we’re about the same. Hard? I’ve got you both beat.”
“That is… such a Ryan sentence,” I say.
“Prove me wrong,” he shoots back immediately.
I bark a laugh. “Right now?”
He shrugs. “We’re already halfway there.” He tips his chin down. It’s not like he’s wrong; the talk’s been heading that way, the air buzzy and weird, my brain doing that thing where it laughs and also sort of… wonders. The couch is comfortable. The door’s closed. It’s just us. Senior summer has this “no rules” feeling that makes dumb stuff feel less dumb.
Dylan shifts on the beanbag, eyes on the TV screen like it might save him. “You two are idiots.”
“And you’re scared to lose,” Ryan says.
Dylan’s mouth twitches. “I’m not competitive.”
“Liar,” I say, because Dylan hates losing at literally anything, he just pretends he doesn’t care. I nudge his ankle with my foot. “He’s poking. Ignore him.”
Ryan holds his hands up like a referee. “Look, we can make it scientific. Timer. Porn video. Tape measurer. No cheating. Just a, y’know, compare and contrast for science.” He wiggles his eyebrows, but then his face goes more normal. “Or don’t. I’m not trying to be a creep. I just think it’s funny. And fair. We talk all this trash—let’s have a scoreboard.”
It’s ridiculous. It’s also very Ryan to turn literally anything into a game with rules. I look at Dylan. Dylan looks at me. There’s that half-smile again, like he can’t believe us but he’s here anyway.
“We could just… not,” Dylan says, but it’s soft, not a hard no.
“Yeah,” I say. My voice comes out even. “I could also just… win.” I hate to admit it, but I’m also fiercely competitive.
Ryan points at me like, see? “My man. Evan, the truth teller.”
He leans forward, grabs the remote, and flips the TV over to a porn site. He doesn’t even make a big deal about it—no crass commentary, just scrolls, lowers the sound, and lets the images roll. The light from the screen bounces blue-white over Dylan’s cheekbones. The room suddenly feels smaller.
Ryan glances at us, less jokey for once. “We good? We can stop if it’s weird.”
I swallow. My mouth is dry; the drink doesn’t help. It is weird. It’s also… not? We’ve been teammates for years, we’ve changed and showered and made dumber bets than this. My heart’s doing a little kick anyway.
“I’m fine,” I say, trying to sound casual. “No touching, no weird stuff. Just… whatever.”
Dylan takes a second. Then he nods, eyes steady. “Okay. Fine. For science.”
Ryan smiles like he just hit a game winner. “Science! Okay. Uh—two minutes warm-up, then we check. Then best of three? Kidding. Maybe.”
“Two minutes,” I say. “And you’re not allowed to talk.”
“Me? Not talk?” Ryan clutches his chest. “Cruel.”
Dylan half laughs. “Set the timer, man.”
Ryan sets his phone on the coffee table between us, clock face bright, thumb hovering over Start. He looks up one last time, and this time the grin is smaller, almost nervous.
“One… two… three.”
He taps the screen. The timer starts. The room goes very quiet except for the fan and the soft, porn sounds.
We lean back. No one says a word. The LED strip slides from blue to purple, slow as a heartbeat.
And that’s where it starts.
I don’t look at either of them. I hook my thumbs in the waistband and shove my shorts and underwear down to my thighs, sit back, and get my hand on myself. I’m already halfway there. Warm, heavy. The porn’s good—some girl on top, riding slow, hands on the guy’s chest, hair stuck to her shoulders. The camera cuts close on where they’re joined and I feel that dumb, automatic pulse in my stomach. I spit in my palm, not subtle, and work it up the shaft.
It’s almost funny how fast my body takes over. My brain is doing a running commentary like, this is insane, but my hand just… goes. I flex my hips once. Pre leaks and makes it slicker. I glance at the time—minute ten left. I focus on the screen, let the rhythm there set mine. The girl’s nails dig into the guy’s shoulders. She bites her lip. I start thinking about Ellie from the diner for half a second, then I stop thinking at all.
I’m hard by the last thirty seconds. I know my shape. Just over seven when I’m fully up, a little curve, veins not crazy but you can see them. Fat head. It looks good in my hand; I know it does. I’m not looking for a mirror, but the angle on the black TV glass gives me a hint and for some reason that makes me throb once more.
The timer chirps.
“Okay boys, time’s up. Let’s compa—” Ryan stops mid-word.
I look at him to smirk, but he’s not looking at me. He’s looking past me, open-mouthed, at the beanbag.
“What,” I start, and then I look too.
Oh.
Dylan’s got his shorts pushed down enough for everything to be out, one hand loose at the base like he doesn’t know what to do with it. He’s not touching, he’s kind of holding it back like he’s trying to be polite. It doesn’t work. The thing swings a little when he shifts his knee and it’s just… more. Longer and thicker and heavier-looking than anything I’ve seen not on a screen. I feel my hand go slack around mine without meaning to.
“Dude,” I hear myself say. It comes out small. “Holy—”
Dylan’s ears go red fast. He tries a laugh and it turns into a breath. “This is—uh. Sorry. Guess I should’ve warned you. Genetics?”
Ryan finds his voice first. “Holy shit, man. That thing is massive.” He leans forward like he’s going to measure it with his eyes. “That’s like… that’s not regulation. How big is that?”
“Shut up,” Dylan mutters, but he’s smiling and dying at the same time. “Like nine, nine and a half.”
“How do girls handle that?” I ask, because the question just falls out.
Dylan looks down at it, then back up. His mouth opens, closes. He swallows. “They don’t,” he says finally. “Or haven’t. I tried. Twice. It… uh… didn’t go far. She said it hurt and we stopped.” He clears his throat. “Other time, she saw it and was like, ‘nope.’ So.”
Ryan blinks. “You’re telling me you’ve never actually—”
“Not really,” Dylan says. He gives this helpless little shrug with his big shoulders. “And I’ve… never gotten a blowjob either.”
Silence. The fan clicks. The LED shifts to pink.
“That’s criminal,” Ryan says, dead serious for once. Then he looks at me, then back at Dylan. “We should fix that.”
I bark a laugh because that’s what my mouth does when my brain overheats. “We? Ryan.”
He lifts both hands. “What? We’re friends. He’s our friend.” Then to Dylan, eyes checking him. “Only if you want. We can stop, we can make more jokes, we can go upstairs and eat chips. I’m just—” He gestures at Dylan’s lap, helpless. “It feels wrong that you’ve never had that. You should know what that feels like.”
Dylan’s chest rises and falls once, slow. His eyes meet mine for half a second and there’s this weird little spark, like static when you touch a doorknob. He looks at Ryan. “You’re serious?”
Ryan nods. “Kinda terrified, but yeah.”
Dylan laughs under his breath. He looks down again, then back at us. “I… yeah. I want to. If you guys are okay.”
My heart does a stupid kick. My hand is still around myself and I let go, tug my shorts up just enough to not be dangling out, because somehow that feels less insane. I wipe my palm on my thigh. “No touching each other,” I hear myself say, like I need to lay rules to stay sane. “But… him, yeah.”
Ryan scoots off the couch and onto his knees before he can talk himself out of it. He’s shaking his hands like he’s about to tape his fingers for a game. “Okay. Okay.” He looks up at Dylan. “Tell me if anything’s bad. Or weird. Or you hate it.”
Dylan nods, jaw tight, the kind of tight that is not anger. He leans back a little, braces his hands behind him on the beanbag, opens his knees without making it a whole performance. He is huge and he is trying not to make us feel small and somehow that makes him hotter. I swallow and shift to the edge of the couch, close enough to be there, not so close I bump Ryan.
Ryan starts slow. He wraps his hand around the base and it doesn’t meet. He blinks at that like he didn’t expect it to be real even though he just saw it. He leans in and kisses the tip first, like testing water. Dylan shivers. It’s small but I see it. Ryan puts his mouth over the head, just the head, and I hear the softest sound from Dylan’s throat, like a held-back word.
“Good?” Ryan asks, voice already a little different.
Dylan’s answer is low. “Yeah.”
I don’t realize I’m moving until I am. I end up beside Ryan, one knee on the carpet, the other foot planted, like I can run if I panic. I don’t panic. Up close it’s… I don’t know. Clean. Warm. Skin stretched tight over thick veins, the head glossy. There’s a bead of pre there and it slides when Ryan sinks a little deeper. I get this electric jolt in my stomach. I don’t even try to put my mouth anywhere; I put my hand flat on Dylan’s thigh and then I pull it back like I touched a stove.
“It’s fine,” Dylan says, breathier. “You can.”
He says it to me. He’s looking straight at me when he says it. That flick of static again.
I set my hand again, lightly, and then I lean in and lick the underside where the head meets the shaft, just a slow stripe. Dylan’s head thumps the wall. Ryan huffs a laugh around him and has to pop off to breathe.
“Okay,” Ryan says, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, eyes bright and a little wild. “Okay, that’s… yeah.”
We trade without talking about it. He takes the tip again, I lick lower, then I try taking more because the curiosity is like gravity. My jaw opens wider than I thought it could. It’s too big to be cocky about it; you can’t fake your way through this. You just go slow. I take what I can, then back off, then try a different angle. My tongue works the underside. My hand wraps what my mouth can’t, which is most of it. Dylan is breathing hard but not loud. His fingers curl into the beanbag like he’s holding on.
“Careful,” he says once, not because he’s worried for himself, but like he’s worried about us. That flips something in my head. I want to do it right. I want him to feel good. I don’t know why I want that so bad, but I do.
Ryan’s confidence kicks in a notch and he finds a rhythm on the top half, slow bobs, tongue flick on every down. I take the rest in my hand and stroke with him, syncing up without meaning to. When he needs air, I slide up and seal my mouth where his was, and he drops to the base to lick and kiss along the thick part, jaw working like he’s eating ice cream too fast. We swap again. No one says anything dumb. It’s just breath and little sounds and the TV rolling in the background like none of this is happening.
“Feels—” Dylan starts, and stops, and then starts again. “Feels really good.”
It hits me then that this is his first. That all the nerves and the size and the quiet are wrapped together and we’re the first ones to do this for him. It makes my chest tight in a different way. I grip him firmer and drag my fist up and my mouth down and his hips twitch once and then still, disciplined, like he’s trying not to hurt us by accident.
“Tell us if you’re close,” Ryan says, voice rough. He’s got a hand on Dylan’s stomach now, fingers splayed, like he’s steadying him.
Dylan nods, eyes half-lidded, cheeks flushed deep. “Yeah. I—” He bites it back, exhales, then his voice goes shaky for the first time. “Close. Don’t—just—hands. Please.”
We both back off with our mouths like we practiced it. I wrap both hands—one on top of the other, doesn’t even cover it all—and Ryan slides his palm over mine so we’re stacked in this clumsy three-handed thing that somehow works. I twist up. He twists down. Pre slicks everything. Dylan’s head falls back and he makes a sound that’s not a word at all.
“Okay—okay—” he says, and then his abs jump under Ryan’s hand and he spills. It hits his stomach, chest, a line up to his collarbone. It keeps coming. We slow our strokes and then let go, let him ride it out. His breath stutters and then evens, and he laughs, shocked, soft. “Jesus.”
We sit there for a second like we forgot what to do. Ryan’s the first to move—of course he is. He reaches to the side, finds the box of tissues we always ignore, yanks out way too many, and shoves half the stack at Dylan with this goofy, bright grin. “Congratulations, sir. You have now officially had a blowjob.”
Dylan covers his face with the tissues for a second while he breathes, then wipes his chest, still red to the ears. “You guys didn’t have to—”
“Wanted to,” Ryan says, fast, then adds, “I mean—yeah. It felt like the right play.”
I’m still on my knees. I realize my own situation hasn’t gone away; I adjust my waistband and sit back on the couch, heart still doing rabbit kicks. I don’t say much. My mouth feels weirdly sweet and my cheeks are hot. I catch Dylan looking at me and have to look away, then look back because not looking feels louder.
He smiles, small, grateful. “Thank you,” he says, simple.
Ryan claps his hands once, too loud on purpose, and stands like a coach ending water break. “All right! Science experiment complete. Results: Dylan is a freak of nature.” He tosses a controller into my lap. “Rematch?”
It’s the perfect out. I snort, roll my eyes, and grab the controller. “Loser does snack run.”
Dylan pulls his shorts up, still grinning and shaking his head like he can’t believe us, then flops back onto the beanbag, calmer than I’ve seen him in weeks. Ryan drops onto the couch beside me like nothing happened and switches back to the game. The TV fills the room again. The fan hums. Somewhere above us a door closes and we all go quiet for a second, then start talking trash like we always do.
The only difference is my tongue remembers the salt-skin taste of a friend, and my chest feels weirdly light. I don’t say that out loud. I just play.

***

It’s one of those late August afternoons where the sky looks tired. Dylan and I end up at the park anyway, taking lazy shots at the half court. He rebounds like a machine and passes back perfect without thinking. We don’t talk about last night. We talk about fries and music and whether Ryan could actually make money talking trash for a living. It feels normal because we’re making it normal.
On the walk back we grab slushies—blue for him, red for me—and wander the long way so the cups have time to melt a little. Dylan’s quiet, which for him is just… Dylan. I fill the empty spots, and he laughs at the right beats. By the time we cut through my street the sun’s dropped behind the roofs and everything smells like cut grass.
Mom’s at the stove when we come in, wooden spoon like a magic wand. “Perfect timing,” she says, and points the spoon at Dylan. “I spoke to your mom and you’re staying for dinner and sleeping over. Your bag’s here, right?”
Dylan blinks, polite mode kicking in. “Oh—I don’t want to impose, Mrs. Cole. I can head home and—”
She waves him off. “You’re not imposing. Your mom said thank you and to text goodnight. George is already setting up the air mattress upstairs,” she calls toward the hallway, which is funny because Dad answers from somewhere, “Almost done!”
Dylan looks at me like, guess I live here now, and smiles. “Thank you,” he says to Mom. He means it.
Dinner is pasta and garlic bread and a salad nobody touches first. Mom asks a thousand tiny questions—work schedules, who’s moving into what dorm, whether we need anything from the store tomorrow. Dylan’s easy with her, answers straight, helps pass plates. Dad comes in sock-footed and squeezes the back of my neck on his way to the table, then checks in with Dylan the way he does—few words, warm tone. It’s familiar. It’s comfortable. Nobody mentions anything we don’t want mentioned.
We rinse dishes after because that’s the routine. Dylan stacks, I load. Mom swats Dad’s hand when he tries to “help” by rearranging the silverware tray and tells us to go before she finds more chores. We head upstairs.
My room’s already got the air mattress out—Dad left it inflated, sleeping bag rolled next to it. Classic. I crack the window. The night air is softer than the afternoon, and the screen hums a little. We throw on some nothing TV—a car show where they complain about rust and then act surprised when there’s more rust. 
We talk around future plans. Dylan might work with his uncle for a few weeks; I might keep my part-time at the store. Ryan’s name comes up, but only as a punchline to a meme he sent. We laugh. Then we don’t talk at all for a while. Not awkward, just… still.
Dylan’s on the air mattress propped on an elbow, eyes on the TV glow bouncing off the ceiling. I’m on the edge of the bed, one foot on the floor. He glances over once, twice, like checking his mirrors before a lane change.
“What does it feel like?” he asks.
I look over. “What?”
“Sucking cock,” he says, steady. No grin, no poke. “Did it feel good? For you.”
I wait for a tease that doesn’t come. I take a sip of water to give my mouth something to do. “It felt nice,” I say. “Weird for, like, ten seconds, then… not. Warm. Kinda… I don’t know. It was all right.” I scratch my knee. “Were we bad at it?”
“You were good,” he says. He means it like a fact, not a compliment.
We let that sit. The car guys talk about a carburetor like it matters to our lives.
Then Dylan: “Can I do it?”
My brain blanks, then comes back. “Do what?”
He holds my eyes. “Can I suck your cock?”
The question lands clean. My chest does that rabbit kick. I glance at the door—already closed—then back at him. He looks calm, like he already decided and he’s giving me space to say no.
“You sure?” I ask, voice lower than I meant. “We can stop whenever.”
He nods once. “I’m sure. I want to know.”
I set the remote down like it might break and slide back a little on the bed, knees apart just enough. My hands hit my waistband and I pause; he’s already moving.
He kneels by the bed, one hand on the mattress for balance, the other warm on my knee. He doesn’t rush. He checks my face, I nod. Static flickers down my spine. He starts with fabric, thumb tracing along where I’m getting hard, then hooks his fingers and I lift my hips. He pulls me out slow, like unwrapping something he doesn’t want to tear.
Air hits. I’m already pretty up. He looks for a second—just looks—and moves my hand away gently to replace it with his. His grip is steady. Not showy. He tries pressure up, drag down, a tiny twist on the upstroke because he feels where I twitch. It’s… natural. Of course it is. He pays attention.
He leans in and kisses the tip first, a soft hello. My breath trips. He opens and takes me in, slow, just the head and a little more, tongue low, no teeth. His other hand rests on my hip, not holding me down, just there. The sound I make isn’t on purpose. He hums like he heard it and liked that he did.
He gets good fast. Draws back, circles with his tongue, sinks a little deeper the next pass. He watches my face more than the TV. Every time he comes up for air he murmurs “sorry” like he’s supposed to be perfect; I shake my head because there’s nothing to be sorry about when it feels like that.
“Good?” he asks once, almost whispering.
“Yeah,” I manage. “Really good.”
He smiles with his eyes and goes again. I keep my hands where he left them—on the bed, on my thighs—no pushing, no coaching. He doesn’t need it. He finds a pace that’s not greedy. His hand covers what his mouth can’t, slick with pre and spit. He’s careful with the parts that are too much, curious with the ones that make me jerk. He learns me like it matters.
Heat builds quick because I was halfway there and because it’s him. I tap his shoulder and he pops off immediately, eyes up.
“Close,” I say. “Where do you—”
“It’s okay,” he says, immediate. “I want to try.”
I search his face for doubt. None. I nod; he nods back like we shook on something important. He takes me deeper than before and holds, breathing through his nose, swallowing once. Stars pop behind my eyes. “Now,” I warn, and it hits. He stays with me, steady hand, steady mouth, rides it out until I have to pull in air like I forgot how.
He eases off, breath a little loud, swallows again with a surprised look like it wasn’t as bad as he thought. He wipes the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand, realizes that’s dumb, laughs under his breath. I pass him the tissue box and he dabs, normal as anything. Somehow that normal bit is the thing that gets me.
We don’t debrief. He sits back on his heels, shoulder against the bed. I breathe and tuck away and pull my shorts up. Our calves touch for a second and neither of us moves.
After a minute he says, “It’s… fine.” Then he corrects himself, small smile. “Good, actually. Not what I thought.”
I nod because words are stuck in my throat. “Yeah.”
He climbs onto the air mattress and flops on his back, finds the remote, flips the input back like we never left. I watch the screen and pretend I care about the race on-screen. We watch in silence for a while. The room feels softer around the edges.
Lights go out after midnight. He turns on his side, back to me, comfortable like always.
In the dark he says, quiet, “It was different.”
“Good different,” I say.
He makes that content sound he makes after a long run. The air mattress rustles once and settles, and that’s the last noise either of us makes.

***

The lot’s half full when I pull in with Ash and Maya crammed in my back seat, Jess in the passenger seat arguing with my playlist like it owes her money. We unload a cooler and two mangled umbrellas and weave down to the sand. Ryan spots us first—of course he does—already shirtless in loud board shorts, sunglasses crooked, arms up like he’s welcoming a tour group. Dylan’s here too, farther down by the water, talking to a couple soccer guys, flip-flops hooked on two fingers.
We throw our stuff in the usual chaotic pile and everyone scatters for the lake. It’s cold for a second and then not, and the group snaps into games like it always does. Keep-away with a foam ball, screeching for no reason, Ryan splash-fouling people like it’s a tactic.
Swimwear makes everybody honest. Ryan’s built lean, all lines and spring, faint V cutting down to his waistband when he stretches; he looks like he could run a mile mid-conversation. Dylan’s in plain black trunks, bigger across the chest and shoulders than I ever clock when he’s in hoodies, natural abs not flexed-to-death, forearms that look like he actually lifts things. I’m… me: athletic without the magazine cover. Sturdy chest, strong legs from drills, not much in the way of a six-pack unless I’m laughing. When we’re side by side in the water I can’t help the stupid compare game—Ryan’s wiry, Dylan’s carved, I’m somewhere in the middle—and somehow it feels fine, like three versions of the same team.
Volleyball spins up on the beach and I get drafted to set. Dylan hangs back until we guilt him in; he times a block like he’s been pretending not to know how, then shrugs like it was luck. Ryan trash-talks everyone evenly and badly. Jess lays out for a save and eats sand; we cheer like she won state. We don’t keep score but we absolutely keep score.
Later we collapse onto towels, sun greasy on our shoulders. The sunscreen bottle starts a tour. “Back?” Dylan taps my calf with it. I roll onto my stomach and he kneels behind me. His hands are warm and steady, not stingy with it, careful at the neck and shoulders where people forget. It’s not a thing, it just feels good. I sit up and do him—shoulder blades first, down the spine, slow enough not to grind sand. He exhales this small content sound he’ll deny later. When I get to the small of his back my hand pauses without meaning to; he doesn’t move, so I finish, normal as anything. The bottle moves on.
Ryan flops next to us with his forearm over his face like he’s in a music video. “You moisturizers done? Team selfie.” We cram in—five sun-squint faces, two bunny ears, one Ryan smirk. He posts it with a stupid caption. Phones buzz and go quiet again. The lake glitters and keeps being the lake.
The day hums by in the good kind of nothing. Popsicles from the snack shack turn everyone’s tongues neon. Someone swears Ellie from the diner is dating a guy from out of town; Ryan pretends to be devastated. We float, we sit in shade, we talk college like we know what we’re doing. It’s easy.
By late afternoon the sun tilts and the heat backs off. We shake sand out of everything we own, load the cooler, and hug people like we won’t see them tomorrow. Ryan yells something about next weekend and someone honks twice on their way out. Dylan and I grab the last of the mess—towels, speaker, the empty sunscreen bottle, the cooler—and head to my car.
The car is quiet at first, the good kind. Windows down. My hair does that wind thing. Dylan rides with his arm out the door, hand surfing the air. We hit the stretch past the baseball fields where the road goes straight for a mile and the radio decides to find a song we both know, so we hum instead of talk.
Halfway to his place he says, not loud, “I did try. Before. You know, fucking.”
I check him quick, keep my eyes on the road. “With who?”
He names a girl from a different school. “She was… into it,” he says, and you can tell he wants to be fair. “We went slow. I thought it would be fine.” He swallows. “It wasn’t. I barely got anywhere and she said it hurt and we stopped. She was nice about it. I wasn’t… good after.” His hand goes palm-down on his thigh like he’s pinning the feeling there.
“Yeah,” I say, because I don’t have a fix and it doesn’t need one. “That sucks.”
He breathes out through his nose. “Makes me think it’s always going to be like that. That I’m… not built for it, I guess. Like people think they want a big one, but they don’t know.”
We hit the light by the hardware store and it turns red, so we sit with it. I drum my fingers on the wheel and pick my words. “Or it’s just not a one-size thing,” I say, and I don’t mean it as a pun but it kind of is. “Like… different people, different pace. Prep matters. Trust matters. Some people won’t want to, and that’s fine. Some will. You’ll find the ones who actually want you. And will enjoy you. You know?”
He looks out the window, jaw eased a little. “Yeah.”
“And, like,” I add, shrugging, “sex isn’t just one move. There’s a lot you’re stupid good at already.” I let that hang with a tiny smile so he can take it as a joke if he wants. He huffs a laugh, the corner of his mouth pulling up.
The light turns and we roll through. He flexes his fingers once on his thigh and then lets them relax. “Thanks,” he says, and it’s simple but full.
“Anytime,” I say, and mean it.
We hit his street and I pull up. “I’ll help with the cooler,” I say, because it weighs a thousand pounds and because I want to.
Inside, the place smells like laundry and whatever candle his mom likes. She’s in the kitchen, phone on speaker with somebody until she sees us and hangs up mid-sentence. “Perfect,” she says, wiping her hands. “Evan, I know your parents are out of town tonight. So you’re staying over.”
“Oh I’m OK,” I say.
“What are you eating tonight?” she asks, eyebrow already up.
“Like… a bowl of cereal,” I admit.
“Exactly,” she says, triumphant. “So you’re staying here. I’ll make enough. No arguments.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Hale,” I say, because you don’t argue with that tone.
Mr. Hale appears in sock feet like dads do and gives me the warm nod. “We loaned our spare mattress to your aunt,” he tells Dylan, a little apologetic.
“We can just share a bed,” Dylan says, too fast, then not taking it back. He looks at me for half a second, steady, and I feel that little static pop under my skin again.
“Fine by me,” Mr. Hale says, because he’s from the practical school of thought and because we’ve been sleepover kids since forever. Dylan’s mom points at the fridge like she’s issuing orders about leftovers and dessert and what time is dinner, and I nod at all of it.
We lug the cooler to the back, the ice sloshing, and the house swallows us up like we’ve always fit there. The day sticks to my skin in a good way. The static hangs around, quiet, waiting.


A couple hours slide by the easy summer way—dinner with his folks (meatloaf, his dad’s quiet jokes, his mom packing leftovers “for later”), a little TV upstairs, then we drift down to Dylan’s basement suite. He ducks into the en-suite first while I scroll through nothing on my phone. He comes out, a towel wrapped around his waist, another one used to dry his hair. I look at him, really look at him, and have to admit his body is pretty amazing. He was never one to brag about it, so I didn’t pay much attention. He has a little bit of chest hair pooling between firm pecs, and a toned flat stomach, with a good hint of a six-pack. 

“Your turn,” he says, which took me out of my reverie. 
I grab a towel, hit the shower, and let the water burn the lake off. When I kill the water, steam rolls around my legs and I wrap a towel at my waist before cracking the bathroom door.

Dylan’s room is cooler than upstairs, that dry-basement cool you only notice when you step out of the bathroom and the air hits your skin. He’s on his bed in black boxer-briefs, phone glow on his chest, one knee up, scrolling nothing. I’ve got the towel around my waist and steam on my shoulders. I drop the towel without thinking to grab clean underwear off the chair, and halfway down I feel it—eyes. I glance back over my shoulder. Dylan’s already looking away too fast to be natural, jaw shifting like he remembered breathing. I don’t say anything. I pull on the briefs and toss the towel toward the hamper even though it misses by a foot.
We talk a little about the lake, about Ryan being Ryan, about Jess eating sand on that dive and acting like it was part of the plan. TV’s on low but we’re not watching, some late movie with a lot of car noise. Lights go off except for the dim one in the bathroom that spills a strip across the floor. We settle. It takes a minute. Sharing a bed feels normal and not, like wearing an old hoodie that fits different.
I roll once. He rolls once. The sheets make small sounds. It’s quiet in that way where your own heartbeat is the loudest thing.
“You awake?” he says, ceiling-voice.
“Yeah.”
A beat. “Could you…help me get to sleep?”
My mouth goes dry for a second. “You mean…with my mouth?”
“Yeah,” he says, soft, not sheepish—just sure.
I shift down under the covers and end up near his hip, the cotton warm from him. He nudges my shoulder, guiding me the rest of the way, and I slide lower, hand skimming the muscle of his thigh. His underwear is already doing nothing for him; I hook a thumb under the band and he lifts a little so I can get them down. He’s heavy in my hand even before I put my mouth on him. I glance up.
“All good?”
He nods once. “All good.”
I take him slow, careful, the way I learned works—hand for the base, mouth for what I can manage, tongue low, no teeth. His breath changes almost right away, chest rising fuller, a quiet sound leaking out that would be a groan if he let it. I find a rhythm and keep it there, not greedy, just steady. His palm lands on my shoulder, warm weight, not pushing, just there. It’s easy to fall into; it’s easier than sleep.
When I come up to breathe he tugs at my hip, a small nudge that means c’mere, and I get it. I swing a knee over and shift my body around until my feet are by his pillow and we’re sort of a 69, not pretty, just close. I lower back onto him, mouth full again, and he drags my briefs down with a quick, careful push. Cool air on my ass. His hand wraps me and starts stroking in a lazy way that makes my spine go loose.
I think he’s going to take me, too—mouth for mouth—and I brace for that, but then his hand spreads me instead, thumb gentle at the inside of my thigh, and his breath is there first. I feel heat, then the first slow lick.
It short-circuits me. My whole body does a little jerk I can’t control and a sound breaks out of me that isn’t a word. I have to pull off him for a second just to breathe around it.
He goes back in, patient, careful, like he’s learning the shape of me with his tongue. Long strokes first, then smaller ones, the tip tracing a circle that makes my knees try to climb the mattress on their own. His hand keeps me steady, jerking me slow to the same beat. I sink my mouth on him again because I need something to do with the noise, but it still leaks out—these stupid little whimpers I didn’t know I had. The room shrinks to warm breath and wet and the way my hips start moving without asking me.
He finds a spot and stays on it, tongue slick and sure, and I melt a little more with every pass. I’m not thinking about anything,not the house, not tomorrow. Just the heat, the pressure, the way his grip tightens when I forget and moan around him. I feel ridiculous and honest and like I could stay here forever.

At some point the pleasure outruns my coordination. I try to keep my mouth on him and I can’t; I’m making too much noise, breathing too hard. I let him slide from my lips and just… hang there, forehead on his thigh, trying not to shake while his tongue keeps doing that impossible thing.
His hand pats my hip, then nudges. “Up,” he says, gentle.
I let him straighten up, knees under me, elbows to the mattress for a second until I get my balance. He stays behind me, big and warm and sure. There’s a soft plastic click—nightstand drawer, a bottle. A cold dot lands where I’m hot and I twitch. His fingers spread it around slow.
“All good?” he asks.
“Yeah,” I breathe.
One fingertip presses, waits, then slips in just a little. He doesn’t push; he lets me take it. The stretch is a bright line that turns warm quick. He eases out, then in, a little more each time, patient as a metronome. When he adds a second finger I gasp and my hands knot in the sheet, but he waits there, not moving, until my shoulders drop. He scissor-moves once, small, and suddenly my body figures out how to want it.
He pulls his fingers out and my hips follow. I’m already reaching back when he says, low, close to my ear, “I’m gonna fuck you now.”
“What?” I say, stupid, like I didn’t hear him.
“You can’t wriggle and whimper like that from getting eaten out and not get fucked,” he says, voice rougher than I’ve ever heard it. “You turned me on so much. Okay?”
I swallow. Everything in me is hot and stupid and saying yes. “Okay.”
He shifts closer. The blunt head of him slides down once, smears slick, then finds me. He holds still a beat, breathes. I’m breathing with him without trying to. The first push is slow, just pressure, and then the ring gives and the head is in and I make a sound I don’t know how to name. He stops there, both hands on my hips, thumbs steady.
“All good?” he says again, tighter.
“Yeah,” I get out. “Keep going.”
He does. A little, stop. A little, stop. It’s a lot. It’s everything. I feel huge and full and split in the best way and then he’s deeper, deeper, and my whole spine hums. He checks on every move without really asking a question; I answer without words, hips rocking back, breath catching, yes, yes, yes. When he bottoms out I feel it in my stomach. He stays there, not moving, chest folded over my back, breathing like he ran.
“Jesus,” he says into my shoulder. “You’re taking it.” It’s not a brag. It’s like he can’t believe it either.
We sit in that for a second until the stretch turns into heat. He rocks out an inch, in an inch. My mouth opens and nothing comes out. He says things he’s never said, voice coming apart: “Oh this feels incredible—fuck—yeah—take it—just like that—” It spills out of him. I don’t talk. I can’t. I moan into the pillow and push back and my body answers him without needing language.
He keeps it slow, like he’s memorizing it. Each stroke is careful, deep, controlled. When he hits a spot inside me I didn’t know I had, my whole chest tightens and a broken noise punches out. “There?” he asks, moving almost not at all.
“Yeah,” I choke. “There.”
He stays with it, patient, the same path each time, and the heat builds in this steady line that doesn’t scare me because he’s right there, every inch a check-in. I reach for myself because I have to; my hand shakes. He catches my wrist, presses it to my cock, and lets go like he’s giving me permission I didn’t need.
We don’t last long. First time, there’s no chance. He gets a little louder, a little messier. “Oh fuck—oh fuck—” The rhythm slips and he grabs it back and then doesn’t, and I feel him thicken and pulse and he pulls out fast at the last second, groaning as he spills hot across my lower back. The sound he makes is going to live in my head for days.
I’m shaking and on the edge and his hand is back on me immediately, slick from earlier, stroking me a little rougher than I manage for myself, and that’s it. I shoot onto the sheets, vision going white around the edges, a noise in my throat I’d be embarrassed about if I had room for embarrassment.
We stay there, panting, both of us folded over the bed like we forgot how to be human. He moves first, fumbles for a towel, wipes me off with this clumsy, careful care that makes my chest hurt in a good way. He tosses the towel somewhere and falls back on the mattress like a tree going down, one arm flung over his eyes. He doesn’t say anything. He’s out in about thirty seconds.
I pull the sheet up, wipe my hand on the clean corner, and sit there long enough for my heart to calm down. The room smells like us and the shower and something new. I look at him—at the rise and fall of his chest, at his stupid perfect mouth—and I can’t believe any of that just happened, or how good it felt.
My body’s heavy in the best way. I slide down next to him, not touching, and stare at the dim strip of bathroom light on the floor until my eyes quit. Then I follow him under.


I wake up to basement quiet and the smell of coffee. Dylan’s on his stomach, one arm flung toward my side of the bed like gravity tried to borrow me. We do the bathroom shuffle without eye contact, shorts back on, hair a mess. Upstairs, his mom plates eggs and toast like she’s timed it to a whistle. 
“You two didn’t go to bed too late, did you?” she asks, and we both answer “No” at the exact same time, which makes her smile. 
I help clear, she packs me a muffin “for the road,” and I’m out the door ten minutes later. No postgame. Just a “text me” at the curb and a chin-up from him that lands somewhere in my chest.



Life fills in. Open gym at the school, half the team plus extras. Ryan is peak Ryan—calling plays that don’t exist, selling fouls, winning anyway. Dylan and I end up on the same side; he boxes out like a wall, I clean up the trash. We talk trash at each other because that’s what we do. Nobody notices anything because there’s nothing to notice. After, there’s Gatorade on the curb and a meme about Ryan’s lake selfie and then everyone peels off to jobs and dinners and normal. That night, at 11:42, my phone buzzes.
Dylan: “All good?”
 Me: “Yeah. You?”
 Dylan: “Yeah. Can I sleep over at your place tomorrow night?”
 Me: “Yeah.”
 Dylan: “Parents home?”
 Me: “Yeah. They crash early.”
 Dylan: “Cool.”
I stare at “Cool” longer than a four-letter word needs.

Dinner is nothing—leftover lasagna, casual conversation with the folks. We retreat upstairs. Door clicked. I inflate the old air mattress out of habit; he drops his bag on my chair and flops onto my bed like he belongs there.
We half-watch a show; we don’t watch at all. He glances over, calm. “Wanna have some fun?”
“Yeah,” I say, because pretending would be dumber than the truth.
We start simple. Clothes slide down to boxer-briefs, then not even those. Knees on the bed, shoulders bumping, we trade—me on him, him on me—easy rhythm, no rush. It’s not a race to finish; it’s a warm-up that gets warm for real. He pulls off first, thumb sliding lazily under my head. “Could you rim me?” he asks, like he’s asking me to switch controllers.
“You want to get fucked?” I ask, because the question sits right there.
“No,” he says, eyes steady. “I want to get rimmed. But if I make the sounds you made…” The corner of his mouth lifts. “Maybe.”
I swallow and nod. He rolls onto his stomach like it’s nothing, then hikes his hips a little and looks back once to make sure I’m still there. I am. I spread him with my hands, kiss the small of his back first because I want to, then lower. The first lick is careful; the second is bolder because his breath leaves his body in a way that feels like permission. He’s clean and warm and tense for three seconds, then he melts. His sounds aren’t loud—just these broken little exhales that tell me exactly where to stay. I stay there. Time gets weird. My name falls out of him once in a way that makes something in me light up.
I reach to my nightstand for… nothing. He taps my calf and reaches into his bag instead, comes up with the small bottle from his place like it was always the plan. “Here,” he says, breathless, and I grin because of course he brought it.
“All good?” I ask into his skin.
“Yeah,” he says, already nodding.
I slick a finger and go slow. He takes it better than I did, but I still wait out the tight parts until they turn into heat. Second finger, careful scissor, the same long stroke of my tongue to keep him loose. His hips start rocking without him noticing. I’m hard enough to ache just from the way he sounds.
“Evan,” he says, voice gone low.
“Yeah?”
He doesn’t finish the sentence. He just pushes back into my hand, and that’s the answer.
I kneel behind him, line up, breathe. The first press is patient. He breathes with me. The ring gives and the head slips in and he sucks in air and I freeze because I remember last time and I’m not about to mess this up.
“Fuck,” I say, quieter.
“Yeah,” he says. “Keep going.”
I do. It’s a lot. He’s tight and hot and it feels unreal, but I keep the pace I wished for last time—slow, steady, precise. When I bottom out, his shoulders drop and he makes a noise that lands straight in my stomach.
We stay there until that big stretch turns into a heat I can move inside. I rock out and in, shallow at first, deeper when I feel him open for it. He’s making more sound than I’ve ever heard from him, these honest, surprised noises that make my spine tingle. “Breathe,” I whisper, not because he needs coaching, because I need to say something. “Good. Just like that.”
He turns his head, cheek to the mattress, and I can see his mouth, the way it keeps trying to find a word and losing it. I keep it slow, memorizing the path that makes him shiver. A few minutes like that and he says, ragged, “Can we—” and taps my thigh. I get it.
We shift to missionary, a shuffle of knees and pillows, his back on my sheets, me between his legs. He hooks his ankles behind my lower back and I slide back in, deeper from this angle, and suddenly there’s nowhere else to look but his eyes. Everything quiets. I move slow because I don’t have a choice; I don’t want to miss anything. He meets me on every stroke, hands on my shoulders, like he wants me closer than I already am.
“I’m close,” I tell him, because honesty feels like the only language I’ve got.
“Me too,” he says, and his legs tighten at my lower back, pulling me in. It’s not a trap; it’s a request. I understand it without him saying it.
We’re breathing the same air now. Our faces hover inches apart. I lean down and he meets me and the kiss is not a joke, not a bet, not a dare. It’s soft for a second and then it isn’t, and we both break at the same time—him with a sound into my mouth, me with a shudder that runs through my whole body. I push deep and stay there and everything goes white around the edges. He clenches on me and spills between us and I feel it on my stomach, and none of it matters except that we’re kissing like we’ve been trying not to for years.
We ease down slow. I rest my forehead against his and breathe until my heart remembers how. He smiles at me like he’s seeing something new and familiar at once. I pull out careful and grab a shirt off the floor that’s already doomed and wipe us both, toss it somewhere I’ll regret later. We lie on our sides, close enough that our knees touch.
“I feel—” he starts, and then stops, searching.
“Me too,” I say, because that’s the only true sentence I’ve got.
I look at his mouth, then back at his eyes. “Can you kiss me again?”
“You don’t have to ask… babe,” he says, almost laughing at himself on the last word, but not enough to take it back.
So I do. We kiss slow this time, small and sure, and at some point my arm ends up under his neck and his hand ends up on my chest and we stay like that until everything in the room blurs. We fall asleep in each other’s arms for the first time, and it feels less like a decision and more like finally letting the obvious happen.

***

I wake up to the hum of the A/C and the outline of Dylan’s shoulder in the early light. We’re half tangled, not all the way; my arm’s a pillow for him and my hand’s on his chest like it got tired and stopped there. His eyes open slow.
“Hey,” he says, morning voice.
“Hey.”
We lie there listening to the house be quiet. I kiss him once, then again, because not kissing him feels dumb now. He kisses back like he already knew we were going to.
“So,” I say, very brave.
“So,” he says, smiling.
“I like you,” I get out. It lands simple.
“Yeah,” he says. “Me too.” A beat. “Like, not just… last night.”
“Same,” I say. We both look at the ceiling for a second like it might have instructions.
He clears his throat. “We don’t have to tell anyone yet. I kinda want it to be ours for a minute.”
“Yeah,” I say, relief sneaking in. “Let’s figure it out first.”
“Public—normal,” he says. “Private—us.”
“Us,” I repeat, and the word does a weird good thing in my stomach.
We kiss once more because it’s right there, then roll out because my mom will definitely knock if we don’t show up. In the hallway we’re just two dudes hunting for coffee. In my room, my pillow still smells like him.

***

The next week stretches out in pieces that stick. Ryan texts a photo of his driveway like it’s a stadium: two folding chairs, a cooler, four orange cones, and a tape line across the concrete. When we roll up he’s got a phone in one hand and a whistle he definitely didn’t earn. “Welcome to the combine,” he says—like the NFL tryout thing—and points us through a loop of sprints, shuffles, jump tests. Dylan runs smooth, easy power. I run like I care in the last ten yards. Ryan argues splits he timed himself and declares everyone a sleeper pick. We play half-court until somebody banks a three and retires on the spot. It’s dumb and sweaty and exactly right.
After, we hit the taco truck. We sit on the curb with our backs to Ryan’s open garage, tees stuck to our shoulders. Dylan passes me the hot sauce without asking; I pass him my lime. Our knees touch because the ledge is narrow, and neither of us moves. Ryan doesn’t notice and narrates his own highlights like a sportscaster who’s in love with the sound of his voice. We heckle him because we’re not.
Another day it’s errands for my mom—milk, paper towels, spices she screenshotted. Dylan pushes the cart because he always does; I cut down aisles like we’re running routes. He grabs the brand of cereal I actually eat without looking; I drop his soda in the cart without asking. At the freezer section we stand there fogging the glass over whether we’re pizza people or stir-fry people tonight. We pick both and promise to “meal plan” like adults we definitely aren’t.
We stop for iced coffee after, even though it’s six and that’s a bad idea. He tries my drink; I try his. He hates mine (too sweet) and I hate his (tastes like bark). We switch anyway for three sips like that solves anything. 
Life feels normal. I expected it to be weird. But it’s not. I am happy, and comfortable with him. We kiss when nobody is looking. Hold hands while watching TV. Still have fun in our bedrooms. A quiet, happy life.

***

It’s an evening that drifts. Dylan and I are in his gaming room, lights low, that stupid LED doing its slow fade. We’re shoulder to shoulder on the couch, controllers in hand, not really thinking about how close we’re sitting. We’ve been at it for an hour. It’s easy to be quiet when you don’t have to hide anything from the person next to you.
The door swings open and Ryan comes down the stairs like he owns them. Dylan and I instinctively spread apart. Like we’re doing something wrong.
 “Gentlemen!” Ryan says, way too loud, then drops onto the beanbag. 
 
“Okay, question,” he says. “You two are being… weird.” He waves his hand. “Is this about the last time we were down here? Because that was, like, a science experiment. No one’s weird about it, right?”
Dylan glances at me. It’s quick and not. “Wanna tell him?”
“I don’t mind,” I say.
Dylan sets his controller down, turns toward me, and says, “Actions speak louder than words.”
He leans in and kisses me. Not a show. Not a joke. Just the thing. I kiss him back and suddenly the room has a new gravity.
Ryan’s eyebrows do a little jump. “Huh.”
We pause the game. Dylan keeps it simple. “We’ve been hanging out. Tried some stuff. Liked it. We… figured we like each other.”
“Yeah,” I add. “We’re keeping it to ourselves for now.”
Ryan stares at the paused screen like it might have answers, then nods slowly. “Okay,” he says. “Okay.” He scratches his cheek, thinking. “I mean, I liked… the thing, too. The blowjob. That was—not gonna lie—pretty great.”
Dylan reaches over and squeezes his shoulder once, easy. Then, because the mood is exactly right for it, he leans in and gives Ryan a quick kiss—testing, friendly, real. I follow with one of my own, just a small kiss, no tongue. Ryan blinks, then grins like he discovered a new game mode.
“Kissing guys is… pretty good too,” he says, sounding surprised at himself but not unhappy.
Dylan and I trade a look we’ve already learned how to read. He turns back to Ryan, mouth tipping into mischief. “You haven’t seen nothing yet.”
Dylan and I lean back in to Ryan, not shy this time. We take turns—first me, then Dylan—quick, testing kisses that turn into open-mouthed, tongue, heat. Ryan blinks through the first one and then gets it, hands going to our shoulders like he needs something to hold. He tastes like soda and whatever gum he chews to look cool.
Shirts go somewhere. Shorts unzip. We get him out of his and his cock pops up hard and eager, no mystery there. We both wrap hands around him like we’ve practiced this forever—my palm under the head, Dylan’s lower, slow twist, lazy pull. Ryan cusses into the room and laughs at himself at the same time.
We slide down together. I take the tip and sink, slow, and Dylan kisses along his shaft then drops to his balls, mouth warm and careful. Ryan’s head tips back against the couch. “Holy shit,” he says, just breath. His hands find our hair—light, not pushing, just there. We swap without talking: Dylan takes him, deeper first pass like he’s been thinking about it, and I slide lower to lick and kiss everything else, hand cupping him so he doesn’t have to hold himself up. It’s messy and good and feels like we’re building something instead of just doing a bit.
Dylan pulls off, crawls up, kisses Ryan hard, then glances at me. “Your turn,” he says, thumb flicking at my waistband.

Ryan looks at me like a dare and kneels on the couch to get the right angle. His mouth is warm and curious; he pays attention, he learns fast. While he’s figuring me out, Dylan’s slid behind him on the cushion, hands on his hips like he’s steadying him, and then I see it—Dylan’s shoulders dip. Ryan goes rigid for half a second and then makes this cracked sound I recognize from my own mouth.
Dylan keeps rimming him, patient, long strokes, then shorter ones. Ryan’s rhythm on me falls apart in a way that’s all right; his hand takes over when his mouth has to leave to breathe. He’s gasping now, little “fuck, fuck,” like he’s shocked at his own body.
Dylan catches my eye over Ryan’s back and makes a small motion with his fingers: come here. I slide off the couch and around. Ryan’s hand, slick from me, is still working and he stops long enough to say, “Wait up. I don’t think…”
“Trust us,” Dylan says, voice low. “You won’t regret it.”
Ryan’s jaw works, then he nods. “Okay. Go slow.”
We do. I grab the lube Dylan had tucked in the drawer and slick myself stupid, then my fingers. Ryan’s tight as a fist at first and then not, breathing like he’s trying to hit a pace. Dylan keeps whispering “good, good,” into the space behind him. I take one finger out and line up, pulse in my throat, and press. The ring gives, the head pops in, and Ryan makes a noise into his arm that sounds like he just got told some good secret.
“All good?” I ask, half-croaked.
“Yeah,” he says, voice ragged. “Yeah—Jesus—yeah.”
I inch in, stop, let him adjust, inch more. Dylan’s got his hands on Ryan’s cheeks spreading him open just enough to help; he kisses the small of Ryan’s back like he means it and then slides his hand forward to wrap Ryan’s cock so he doesn’t have to think. When I’m finally all the way in, I stop. It’s a lot. It feels too good. I put one hand on Ryan’s hip and one on the couch and breathe.
“Move,” Ryan says, surprised at himself. “Please.”
I do. Small at first, slow, and he opens around me like his body figured out what it wants. Dylan moves in front of him. Presenting his massive cock to his mouth. Ryan opens up and takes it all in. Bobbing on it best he can as I slam his ass.
Dylan looks up, eyes dark, and grins at me. “Come on, babe,” he says, voice thick. “Fill him up with your cream. Lube him up for me.”

The words hit me in the spine. Ryan gasps and swears and tries to suck Dylan’s cock when Dylan guides him around; he gets his mouth on just the head and moans like he can’t believe the weight, like he forgot how to coordinate. Dylan lets him try, lets him taste it, pulls his hips forward a little. We’re a line, a stupid beautiful one: me fucking Ryan from behind and Ryan getting his mouth full of my man’s manhood.
I don’t last. None of us do. Ryan’s hand finds himself and he starts jerking messy in time with me. His insides go tight around me like a fist and he shudders; I feel it before I hear it. I tip over with him, groan, and spill. It’s hot and deep and I can’t breathe for a second. Ryan’s whole body jumps and he cums too while he whimpers around Dylan’s tip.
I drop onto his back, laughing out a breath I didn’t know I was holding, and kiss his shoulder, then the side of his neck because it’s right there, then his mouth when he turns his head. He kisses back, eyes wild and happy. Dylan’s watching us with that half-smile he gets when he’s filed something away forever.
“Switch,” he says, voice gone low and unreadable. He eases Ryan forward onto the couch, flips him to his back like he weighs nothing, shivery and overstimulated, and fall onto the cushion next to Ryan, chest heaving.
I turn my head to him. “If you enjoyed that,” I say, half-grin, half-truth, “you’re gonna love what happens next.”
Ryan blinks, dazed. “What—”

Dylan answers by lining up. He strokes once, slicking himself with what I left, and pushes. It’s slow, sure, deeper than me because he’s Dylan, and Ryan’s face does something I’ve only seen on movie posters—shock tipping into awe. Dylan groans like someone just handed him the right answer key and starts moving, steady, not cruel, just bigger everywhere.
I watch, and it does something to me I don’t have language for. Watching my boyfriend fuck our friend, seeing Ryan take it and love it, seeing Dylan focus like this is the only game that matters—it winds me back up fast. I lean in and kiss Ryan to keep him anchored, thumb under his jaw so he can breathe. “You good?” I say into his mouth.
“So good,” he says, almost laughing. “So—fuck—good.”
Dylan finds the angle and Ryan’s noise goes high and honest. “Right there,” Dylan says, not a question, and keeps it, hips rolling like he’s memorizing a path. I talk to Ryan because I can’t not—little nonsense things, “you’ve got it,” “breathe,” “look at me”—and he does, eyes blown, hand grabbing my forearm like a handle. I kiss him again because I want my mouth on his while Dylan rocks him open.
It doesn’t take long, round two or not. Ryan shudders hard and spills again, this time on his abs, painting his chest and my knuckles. Dylan swears, grips Ryan’s hip, and buries with one last push, head tipped back, jaw set, sound punched out of him. He stays inside a breath too long and then eases out, careful, like he’s laying something down, not dropping it.
He tips forward, kisses me—quick, grateful—then kisses Ryan’s cheek, softer. I hand him the abandoned towel and he cleans Ryan up, then me, then wipes his hand on it and tosses it toward the corner.

We end up in a pile without thinking, Ryan on my side because he can’t move yet, Dylan on the other, his face nestled in my neck. The room smells like sweat and sex.
“Fuck, that was great,” Ryan says to the ceiling. He turns his head enough to smirk at us. “But that didn’t make me gay.”
We all crack up because it lands exactly right.
He stares at the LED for a second, then adds, “Although I wouldn’t mind doing it again.”
“Anytime,” Dylan and I say together, and then we can’t help it—we kiss, slow and easy, because that’s our center and we like being there.
Ryan throws an arm over his eyes and laughs to himself. We breathe. The controller light is still paused blue on the table like it’s waiting for us to unpause our whole lives.
I stare up at the ceiling and the stupid strip light and think, It all started with finding out how hung my best bud was. And now I’m here, in the middle of this messy perfect thing, in love with him. Life has a way of doing things and I am forever grateful to it.
