It was my last day in Brazil, and I still hadn’t gotten laid. Not even once.
Honestly, I didn’t see that coming. I mean, I’m not trying to sound full of myself or anything, but back in the States I usually don’t have to try that hard. I go to the gym, I’ve got the abs, the arms, the whole package. Girls dig that. I’m good-looking, and yeah — I’m packing too. Not that I bring it up in conversation, but it helps when the clothes come off. It’s a good combo. Never really failed me before.
But Brazil? Whole different story.
The women here are something else — all curves, smooth skin, barely-there bikinis and legs that go on forever. I thought I’d be in paradise, living out every wet dream I ever had. Instead, I spent most nights drinking alone, wandering back to my hotel room with nothing but a half-chub and blue balls.
I told myself it was the language barrier. Or maybe they thought I was just another dumb tourist. But deep down, I knew the truth: these girls weren’t looking for some gringo. They wanted Brazilian guys— with their thick bodies, thick thighs, thick everything. I mean I looked just as good as the guys here. Better, even. So I don’t know what the hell the problem was.


I was sitting on the sand, propped up on my elbows, sunglasses on, watching the waves roll in. The sun was hot as hell, baking my skin. I wasn’t even trying to flirt anymore. Just killing time before my flight tomorrow.
That’s when I saw them — three women walking by, laughing, hair wet from the ocean, skin glistening in the sun. I couldn’t help but stare. They were exactly my type. I gave them a quick smile as they passed, but they didn’t even glance at me.
Their eyes were locked on someone else.
I looked away to see who it was.
He was walking along the shore like he owned the whole damn beach. Late 30s, maybe, but his body looked carved out of granite. Thick chest, wide shoulders, abs like stone. He wore a green and yellow speedo with the Brazilian flag stretched tight over his crotch — and he was definitely packing.
I wasn’t even trying to look, but it was hard not to notice.
The girls were still staring at him, practically drooling. And I couldn’t blame them. Hell, I was staring too.
There was something about the way he moved. Confident. Relaxed. Like he didn’t need to try — like he already knew he was the hottest thing on this beach.
When he got close, he looked right at me. And he smiled. Not friendly. Not polite. It was cocky. Like he knew something I didn’t. Like he saw through me, and found it funny.
My mouth felt dry. My heart was beating too fast for no reason. I looked away, pretending to check my phone, like I wasn’t phased.
He kept walking.
I stayed there a few more minutes, but something felt... off. Like I’d just been hit with a wave I didn’t see coming. I couldn't stop replaying that smirk in my head. The way he looked at me.
What the hell was that?
I finally stood up, brushing sand off my legs. Time to head back to the hotel. I needed a cold shower and maybe a beer. Or two.



I walked back to the hotel barefoot, sand still stuck to my ankles, my flip-flops slapping against the tile floor of the lobby. The air conditioning hit me like a wall. Cold, sharp — almost a shock after the sun. I muttered a “boa tarde” to the receptionist, who didn’t look up.
In the elevator, I caught my reflection in the mirrored wall. Sunglasses on, shirt slung over one shoulder, muscles still hot from the sun. I looked good. I knew I looked good. So why the hell did I feel… weird?
It wasn’t just the fact that I hadn’t gotten laid. That was annoying, sure, but whatever — dry spells happen. It was that guy on the beach. The way he walked. That smug little smile he gave me. Like he was better than me.
I shook it off. Took a cold shower back in my room, letting the water beat down my back and shoulders. Stared at the tile for a while, brain still spinning. My body felt fine — relaxed, even. But my thoughts kept drifting back to that damn smirk. Those thick thighs in that tiny speedo. The way he looked like he knew something about me that I didn’t.
"You're losing it, man," I muttered, drying off.
Back on the bed, I checked my phone. A few messages on Tinder from matches back in the States — nothing new. I didn’t even bother replying. My flight was in the morning, and tonight was basically a write-off.
That’s when the reminder pinged.
5:00 PM – Massage
Right. I’d almost forgotten I booked that. Figured it’d be a decent way to unwind before a long flight. My shoulders were still tense from sleeping on hotel pillows all week. Honestly, I was kind of looking forward to it.


The spa was quiet — dim lighting, that faint smell of eucalyptus and whatever the hell else they put in oils. A woman at the desk smiled and checked the computer when I gave her my name.
“Ah, Mr. Ryan. Your masseuse had an emergency and won’t be available,” she said, in slow, accented English. “But we have another therapist free now, if you are okay with change?”
I shrugged. “Yeah, that’s fine.”
She smiled politely and handed me a little folded towel. “Please, room three. You can undress and lie down. They’ll be in shortly.”
Room three was small but clean. Soft music played from a speaker in the corner — slow, rhythmic, like waves hitting a shore. A faint blue light glowed under the massage table. I undressed, folded my clothes on the chair, and lay down on the table, face in the donut-shaped cradle, towel draped over my ass.
The room was cool against my warm skin. I could feel the hum of the air conditioner above me. I closed my eyes and let out a slow breath.
Just relax, I thought.
Then the door opened. I turned my head instinctively, just to see who walked in. My heart kicked in my chest. It was him. The guy from the beach.
Only now he wasn’t wearing that tiny speedo — he was in a crisp white polo with the hotel’s logo embroidered on it, and loose white shorts.
I froze. He looked at me briefly, then gave a polite nod.
"Good evening," he said, his accent thick. "I’m Thiago. I’ll be doing your massage today."
My mouth opened, but no words came out. I wanted to say something — ask if this was a joke, if he was serious — but nothing came. My tongue felt heavy in my mouth.
He didn’t wait. He moved like a professional, completely at ease, grabbing a bottle of oil and rubbing it between his palms. Then his hands landed on my shoulders — warm, firm, confident.
The first touch made me tense, but not in a bad way. His thumbs slid deep into the muscle at the base of my neck and moved in slow circles. Instantly, my body reacted. My shoulders dropped. My arms went slack.
It felt amazing.
Hot oil trickled down my back, and his hands followed, strong and smooth, working over every inch like he’d memorized where people carried their tension. He kneaded deep into the muscle, moving with just enough pressure to make me let out a low sound from my throat. I didn’t mean to — it just slipped out. A soft moan. Not loud, but definitely real.
He kept going, silent and focused.
His hands moved from my shoulders down along my spine, circling low, then up again. Another moan slipped out of me, deeper this time. It caught me off guard. I’d never made a sound like that during a massage — hell, I didn’t think I was the kind of guy who did that. But now that it had happened twice, I couldn’t stop.
Every time he hit the right spot, a noise came out of me. My face flushed against the headrest. I didn’t want to sound like I was getting off, but it was starting to feel... close.
He never said a word. His rhythm never broke. His hands kept working over me like I was nothing but a body that needed fixing.
I lost all sense of time. Ten minutes? Thirty? I didn’t know. I only knew that whatever he was doing, it was better than any massage I’d had in my life. My whole body felt weightless. Every muscle loose and warm. I could’ve stayed there forever.
Then something changed.
His fingers slowed at the small of my back. The towel shifted a little. I felt the edge of it pull away slightly. He didn’t remove it — just adjusted it. And then his touch paused.
He stepped around the table and placed two fingers gently on my jaw. He turned my head toward him.
My eyes were half-closed. I was floating. I didn’t say anything. I didn’t move.
He stood there beside me, so close I could feel the heat from his skin. He unbuttoned his shorts, pulled them down — and revealed himself.
His cock hung heavy between his legs, thick and uncut, a shade darker than his light brown skin. It looked huge even soft, but it was already growing. I couldn’t help but notice the contrast — I was cut, he wasn’t. He was bigger. Much bigger.
He didn’t say a word. He touched my lower lip with his thumb, gently parting it. Then he pressed the head of his cock against my mouth.
And I let him.
My lips opened. I took him in.
The heat of him, the weight, the scent of his skin — it all filled my senses. My tongue moved without me thinking. I opened wider, sucked deeper. His cock slid over my tongue, growing thicker as it filled my mouth.
Panic flickered in my chest. I was straight. This wasn’t supposed to happen. I shouldn’t be doing this. I shouldn’t want this.
But I did.
I didn’t stop. I kept sucking.
His hips moved slightly, feeding me more. His hand rested lightly on the back of my head, not forcing — just guiding. My mouth opened wider, taking as much as I could. I could feel my own cock straining hard against the massage table, untouched.
He let out a low breath. Then another. And with one more slow thrust, he came.
His cock pulsed in my mouth, spilling hot, thick cum onto my tongue. I swallowed automatically. My throat worked, and I tasted him. My heart was racing. I didn’t understand what I was doing, only that I couldn’t stop.
He pulled out slowly, wiped himself with the edge of the towel, and tucked himself back into his shorts like nothing happened.
Then he looked at me and smirked.
"Hope you enjoyed your massage," he said.
And he left. The door closed behind him.
I lay there, stunned. My lips were wet. My face was flushed. My dick was still rock hard, pressed against the table, aching.
I hadn’t touched it. I hadn’t said a word. But I’d sucked his cock. And I liked it.
I got up in silence. Dressed quickly. I didn’t jerk off. Doing that felt like it would be crossing some invisible line I didn’t understand yet.
I left the spa and went back to my room. Still hard. Still confused. And still thinking about his cock in my mouth.



I didn’t go back to my room right away.
I wandered the halls for a bit, trying to clear my head, even though it felt like it was full of fog. My skin still tingled from the massage, and I couldn’t stop tasting him. I kept rubbing my lips like that would somehow undo what happened. But it didn’t.
I headed directly for my bathroom. I stood under the shower again. Not to clean off — just to feel something cold. I leaned against the tile, eyes closed. Nothing helped. The more I tried not to think about it, the more it played back in my head. Over and over. His cock sliding past my lips. The weight of it. The heat. The way I kept sucking.
I dried off, threw on jeans and a clean shirt, and left. I couldn’t sit in that room. I needed to do something. Needed to feel normal again.


The hotel bar was dim and loud, full of that fake class you only find in overpriced resorts. A few women were clustered at the far end — two Brazilians, one maybe American. I couldn’t tell anymore.
I ordered a whiskey, neat, and sat where they could see me. Smiled. Waited.
After a few minutes, I picked the American-looking one and made my move. I walked up, said hi, told her she looked good. She smiled at first, polite. I asked if she wanted to go up to my room — a weak attempt, more desperate than smooth. She glanced at her friends, then back at me.
"Sorry," she said, still smiling, but it was the kind of smile that meant no.
I nodded, backed off, left my half-empty glass at the bar. Walked out with my tail between my legs.


Back in my room, I didn’t turn on the lights. I sat on the bed and stared out at the glowing pool below.
I told myself I could still jerk off and feel normal. Just a reset.
I unzipped my jeans, slid my hand down, already half-hard.
I tried to think about the girl from the bar. Her dress. Her legs. The sound of her voice.
But then, like a crack through the wall, he appeared again. Thiago. His cock. Thick. Heavy. The way it filled my mouth. The feel of it pulsing against my tongue. The sound he made when he came.
I groaned and stopped. I didn’t finish. I couldn’t.
I pulled my hand away and stared at the ceiling, frustrated and confused. My dick still hard. My thoughts completely wrecked.


Room service came. I barely touched it. Just let it sit on the table while I paced.

I tried to sleep. Got into bed, turned off the light. Rolled onto my side. Closed my eyes.
But thoughts of him were still there. Quiet at first, then louder. His voice, his skin, that damn smirk. His cock again, flashing behind my eyes like it was burned in.
I gave up.
Slipped out of bed and sank into the little couch under the TV. Turned it on, kept the volume low. A dubbed action movie played in Portuguese. I wasn’t paying attention.
Then — a knock on the door. Three quick taps.
I froze.
Stared at the door like it might vanish. But deep down, I already knew who it was.
I opened the door.
It was him. Of course it was.
Thiago stood there, in the same white polo and shorts, but now a six-pack of cold beer dangled from one hand. He gave me that same smirk from earlier — not warm, not cruel, just like he knew something I didn’t.
"Boa noite, rapaz," he said.
Then, without waiting, he stepped inside.
I just stood there for a second, blinking, heart pounding. I didn’t even think to stop him. I closed the door quietly behind him and followed.
He sat down on the couch like it was his, leaned back, legs open, comfortable. He set the beer on the low table and cracked one open, then held another out to me.
I took it without a word.
The TV was still playing — some noisy action scene dubbed in Portuguese. We watched for a bit in silence. His thigh pressed against mine. Not an accident. He didn’t move it. Neither did I.
The beer was cold in my hand. I took a sip, trying to ignore how my whole body was humming.
After a while, he grabbed the remote and changed the channel. A porn channel. Straight. A guy going down on a woman, her legs over his shoulders. Loud moaning.
I glanced at him, but he didn’t look back. Just kept watching, one arm thrown over the back of the couch like this was the most normal thing in the world.
Then his other hand moved to my thigh.
He started kneading it — slow and firm, like I was still on the massage table. My skin twitched under his palm, but I didn’t stop him. I didn’t even flinch.
He changed the channel again. Gay porn now.
A pale white guy on all fours, moaning as a darker-skinned man fucked him deep and slow. The camera lingered on the cock — thick, uncut, huge. The guy getting fucked had the same look on his face I must’ve had earlier. Confused. Turned on. Lost.
Thiago muttered something in Portuguese: “Isso vai ser você hoje à noite, rapaz.”
I looked at him, not understanding. His hand squeezed my thigh again, firmer this time.
"This going be you tonight… rapaz," he said, in slow, broken English. "Fucked like this."
My heart kicked. I didn’t say anything.
The words scared me — but also lit something in my stomach I didn’t want to name. My cock twitched in my jeans.

Thiago pulled a joint from his pocket. He lit it with a match, took a long drag, then let the smoke drift from his nose. He passed it to me. I took it.
We passed it back and forth a few times. I didn’t ask questions. I just breathed it in, felt the tension in my body blur a little.
Then he took a deep puff, held it in, and turned my head with his fingers. I let him.
He leaned in and exhaled into my mouth — warm, slow — and before I could even process it, his lips were on mine. He kissed me. Not soft. Not careful. It was forceful. Full of pressure. Tongue. Heat.
I didn’t know how to kiss back at first. I tried, fumbling. It wasn’t like kissing a girl. He didn’t give me space to lead. He was in control — and I let him be. He kissed like he owned my mouth.
We pulled apart for a second, both breathing heavier. Then he kissed me again, deeper this time.
While our mouths were locked, he grabbed my wrist and brought my hand to his crotch. It was hard. Thick. And he made sure I felt every inch of it through the fabric.
Then, slowly, he pulled the waistband down.
His cock sprang free.
Long. Thick. Darker than the rest of his skin. The foreskin still covering the tip.
He slid it back slowly, revealing the flushed head. It looked even bigger like that — glistening, alive.
“Eu aposto que você nunca viu um tão grande, rapaz,” he said, cock twitching as he said it.
Then, in rough English, “I bet you never see one this big, rapaz.”
I stared.
I couldn’t speak. Couldn’t look away.
He placed his hand on the back of my neck and gave a light push.
“I’m… I’m straight,” I said, barely above a whisper. The words felt weak even as I said them. Like I didn’t believe them anymore.
Thiago chuckled — a low, amused sound that made my skin prickle.
“Claro que é,” he murmured, then pushed again.
I didn’t resist. I opened my mouth, unsure, heart pounding, and leaned forward.
His cock hovered in front of my face, thick and proud, foreskin still half-pulled back. I let my lips brush against the tip, tasting salt, then opened wider and took him in slowly, inch by inch.
This time, I was the one choosing to do it.
I sucked carefully at first. My jaw stretched wide, tongue sliding along the underside as I eased him deeper. My hands gripped the edge of the cushion, trying to steady myself as my mouth worked around his cock — heavy, uncut, warm.
Thiago groaned softly above me, hand resting on the back of my head, not pushing — just there.
Then he shifted forward on the couch, spreading his legs more.
He reached down and pulled me gently by the shoulders, guiding me off the couch and onto my knees in front of him.
He grabbed both sides of my face with his hands. And started fucking my mouth.
Slow at first — long, measured thrusts that pushed deeper than I thought I could take. His grip tightened, keeping my head still as he moved his hips, his cock sliding over my tongue again and again, his foreskin brushing my lips each time he pulled back.
I moaned around him. I couldn’t help it.
My hands went to his thighs again, holding on as he used my mouth like it belonged to him. He was breathing harder now, but not close — not yet.
Then he stopped. He pulled out slowly, my mouth slack and wet, lips parted.
He stood up.
“Hora do próximo passo,” he said. “Time for… next step.”
He looked at the bed, then back at me.
“On bed. All fours.”
I hesitated.
Not because I didn’t want to — I didn’t know what I wanted anymore — but because I was scared. My heart raced. My skin was hot.
Still, I moved. Got on the bed. Hands and knees. My arms were shaking.
I felt him behind me.
He pulled my underwear down in one motion, baring me completely. I felt the air on my skin. I felt exposed.
He spread my cheeks with both hands.
“Que bunda bonita, rapaz,” he said.
“Such a pretty hole, rapaz,” he added, voice lower now.
“Made to be fucked.”
I tensed.
Then I felt his tongue.
It pressed against me — warm, wet — and he didn’t hold back. He licked like he meant it, like he needed it. His hands kept me spread as he devoured me, no hesitation, no shame. His tongue moved in tight, slow circles, then deeper. His breath was hot. His stubble scraped my skin. He ate me like a man starving.
I moaned. Loud.
The sound escaped before I could stop it. My legs trembled. I gripped the sheets.
He kept going.
His fingers dug into my ass as he pulled me open even more, tongue fucking me until my arms gave out and I buried my face in the mattress. My cock was rock hard beneath me, untouched.
When he finally stopped, I was panting. Dripping. Ready. Scared.
Then I felt it — the head of his cock, pressing against my hole.
“Devagar, rapaz,” he said. “Slow…”
He pushed.
Just the tip at first. I winced, my whole body clenching.
“Take it… take it all,” he breathed, voice thick.
He moved slowly, easing in. My breath caught. My muscles fought it at first — then surrendered. Inch by inch, he sank into me.
It felt huge. Too much.
But I let him in.
I gasped as the head stretched me open, my entire body tensing around him.
He paused, just inside, breathing through his nose, one hand on my lower back.
“Relaxa, rapaz,” he murmured. “Breathe… let me in.”
He pushed deeper.
My breath caught as another inch slid into me. It felt impossible. Too much. Like he was splitting me in half. My muscles burned, my thighs trembled, but I didn’t stop him.
When he was all the way in, buried to the hilt, I couldn’t breathe for a second. I just stayed still, eyes wide, hands gripping the sheets.
Then he moved. Slow at first. Long, deep thrusts that filled me completely. I moaned. High. Raw.
I couldn’t believe the sounds coming out of me. I sounded like the girls I used to fuck — soft, breathy, helpless. And yet I kept moaning. I couldn’t help it. I didn’t want to.
His hips slapped against me, faster now. I could feel his cock hitting something deep inside me that made my toes curl. Each thrust knocked the air out of me. He held me steady by the hips, pulling me back into him, again and again.
I thought I was big — but Thiago was bigger. Harder. Relentless.
I was being fucked. Fully, completely. My mind couldn’t catch up with my body. My cock was hard beneath me, leaking onto the sheets, untouched.
All I could do was take it. All of him.
Then he pulled out, turned me over.
I was on my back, legs open, staring up at him.
“Você quer me ver” he said, then smirked. “You want see me fuck you like this.”
He pushed back in.
Missionary now. Deeper than before. His body on mine, chest to chest. He kissed me again — hungry, rough. My mouth opened for him.
He kept fucking me while we kissed, his hand wrapped around the back of my neck, holding me there.
I came. No hands. No warning.
I moaned into his mouth as my body tensed, cock twitching between us. I felt it hit my stomach, hot and sticky. He grinned.
“Americanos… love Brazilian dick,” he said, laughing.
Then he fucked me harder. Deeper. Like that made him proud.
His hands gripped my hips as he started to lose control, breath ragged, muscles flexing.
“Vou te encher, rapaz,” he growled. “I go fill you, rapaz. Fill your… tight hole with my man cream.”
He buried himself deep. And came inside me. Hot. Flooding. So much I felt it leak around his cock. I cried out — not in pain. In something else. Something I couldn’t name. He stayed there for a moment, breathing hard, still buried in me.
Then he kissed me again.


He had fucked me. His load was inside me. I thought he was done.
Boy was I wrong.
He stayed inside for a while, breathing against my neck, his cock still buried, still hard. I lay under him, dazed, sweat cooling on my skin, my hole pulsing from the stretch. His lips brushed my shoulder, his breath hot against my ear.
Then, he started to move again — slow, steady strokes like the first round was just warming up.
“De novo, rapaz,” he muttered, his voice thick. “Again… I not finish.”
He wasn’t joking. His cock was still rock hard inside me, like it hadn’t just emptied itself moments ago. If anything, it felt harder. Thicker. Like my body was meant to keep taking it until he decided he was done.


He didn’t ask.
He just grabbed me by the waist and lifted me up off the bed like I weighed nothing. My legs barely worked, but he supported me easily, pulling me in close until my back was flush against his chest.
I could feel his cock, still hard, wet from the last round, nudging between my cheeks.
He kissed my neck — slow, hungry — then growled something against my ear.
“Permanecer em pé, rapaz. I fuck you… standing now.”
His arms wrapped around me, holding me there, cock pressing at my entrance again. I gasped as he slid inside. No resistance now — I was used to him. My body accepted him like it was built for this.
He held me tightly as he started to thrust — deep, smooth strokes from behind, his breath hot against the back of my neck. It was too much. Too close. Too intense. I gripped his forearms, mouth open, moaning with every thrust.
“Você sente tudo isso?” he murmured. “You feel all of me?”
I just nodded, eyes rolling back. I couldn’t speak.
He fucked me like that for a while, upright, his hands roaming my chest and stomach, teasing me, owning me. But I was too weak to stay upright for long.
Eventually, I bent forward, leaning against the mattress. My arms braced on the bed, forehead pressed down into the sheets, panting. My ass was arched back toward him, exposed and ready.
Thiago grabbed my hips. And started slamming into me. Harder than before.
The sound of it echoed in the room — loud, wet slaps that made me wince and moan at the same time. I couldn’t stop the sounds pouring out of me. My throat was raw. I was beyond control, beyond pride.
A heavy thump came from the wall next door — a knock, maybe a fist. Someone wanted us to keep it down.
My face burned in shame, but Thiago just laughed under his breath and drove into me harder. He didn’t care.
“Deixa eles ouvir,” he said, voice thick. “Let them hear… how good I fuck this ass.”
I let out a cry — long and helpless, my knees buckling under me. I came again. Untouched. I felt it drip onto the floor, warm and thick, splashing near my feet as my body shuddered.
Thiago groaned behind me.
“Você aperta tão bem… rapaz…” he growled. “You… still so tight…”
One final thrust — deep, brutal. And then he came again.
I felt it — his cock pulsing, twitching — another load pumping deep inside me. I was already overflowing, but he didn’t stop until he was completely spent.
Finally, he let go of my hips. And I collapsed. Right there on the floor, chest down, arms limp, body shaking. My legs didn’t work. I couldn’t think.
I was just… used. And I liked it.


He sat down on the bed next to me–pulling me between his legs.
His cock was still hard. Still wet. Still leaking.
“Limpá-lo, rapaz,” he said. “Clean it… with your mouth.”
I opened up without hesitation.
The taste of his cum was still thick on him. My mouth wrapped around the head, tongue swirling gently. I moaned around him, savoring the heat, the salt, the rawness of it. His foreskin was slick, soft, rolling slightly as I sucked deeper.
I wasn’t rushing now. I was worshipping him.
My hands gripped his thighs. My mouth moved slow, steady, trying to show how much I wanted this. Not just to serve him — but to belong to him. The more I licked and sucked, the harder he got. Like my mouth was his fuel.
He sighed, almost tender, and placed a hand on the back of my head.
“Boa boca. Boa… rapaz.”
His hips began to roll gently, feeding more of his cock into my mouth with each motion. I choked a little, eyes watering, but I didn’t stop. I didn’t want to. My throat worked around him, and I let the spit drip down my chin, messy and real.
I could’ve stayed like that forever. But Thiago had other plans.
“Chega disso,” he said. “Enough… now I fuck you again.”
He stood up, and his cock slapped against his stomach — shiny, veined, impossibly hard.
He didn’t even look tired. I was exhausted, but I wasn’t ready to stop either.


I lost track of time.
The room smelled like sex. The sheets were soaked. My skin was sticky with sweat and slick from everything he’d poured into me.
I was on my side now, legs bent, barely conscious, and he was behind me again — his chest against my back, his arm hooked around my waist, cock already pushing in one more time.
He didn’t ask. He didn’t have to.
“Última rodada, rapaz,” he whispered against my neck. “Last round…”
He pushed in slowly, his cock parting me with ease. I was used to it by now — stretched, sore, but still aching for more. The head slid in, followed by his full length, and I moaned like it was the first time all over again.
He kissed my shoulder as he started to thrust — slow, grinding movements that filled me completely. His arm held me tight to him, like he didn’t want to let go. His hand drifted up to my chest, fingers pressing lightly against my sternum, my throat, my lips.
“You take it so good, rapaz,” he murmured. “So… perfect.”
Every stroke sent a pulse through me. I could feel his breath at my ear, his sweat against my back, his cock rubbing deep with every motion.
I was trembling. Overstimulated. Everything inside me felt raw and open. I gasped with each movement, mouth open, drool slipping out onto the sheets. He kissed the back of my neck, moaning into my skin.
He didn’t speed up this time. He just kept going. Slow. Deep. Unrelenting.
I didn’t know how many times I’d come. I didn’t even have anything left to shoot.
Thiago pulled me closer, then gave one final thrust — hard, deep, possessive.
He groaned into my neck as he spilled inside me again. I felt it — every pulse, every twitch. The final load.
His hand gripped my chest, holding me against him as he emptied himself. He stayed there for a moment. Breathing. Then he kissed the side of my face.
“Bom trabalho, rapaz,” he whispered. “Good job… great fuck.”
He pulled out slowly. My body gave out. Muscles loose, hole dripping, breath shallow — I fell asleep, still stretched open from him.


I woke up to hands. Rough, warm, familiar.
Moving over my chest, down my stomach, cupping my ass. I blinked slowly, groggy, muscles aching, sore all over — especially between my legs. My hole throbbed.
It came back to me in pieces. The night. The weight of his body. His voice in my ear. His cock inside me again and again and again.
Thiago.
I felt him behind me — his chest against my back, his breath steady, slower than mine. His cock was pressed between my cheeks, thick and heavy, slowly hardening.
He reached down, dragged the head of it along my hole — slow, teasing strokes that made me twitch.
“Seu buraco tá implorando pelo meu pau, rapaz,” he whispered.
Then, after a pause: “Your hole… is begging for my cock, rapaz.”
I wanted to say no. I should’ve. My body was sore, overstimulated. Used. But I didn’t say no. I reached back instead. Pulled one cheek open, exposing myself to him.
Thiago snickered. Low and pleased. He pushed in.
I expected pain — but there wasn’t any. Just pressure. A fullness that felt right. Like something clicking into place. Like I’d had an empty space inside me this whole time and now it was finally filled.
We stayed like that for a while, spooned together, his cock working in and out of me slow and deep. He kissed my shoulder, my neck. He groaned when I pushed back into him.
Then he rolled me forward, pressing me onto my stomach. I felt his weight above me, his hips angling higher. He started to fuck me harder.
The sound of skin on skin filled the room again. The mattress shifted under us. I buried my face in the pillow, moaning, gasping, gripping the sheets.
But my cock didn’t get hard. And I didn’t care.
All the pleasure was in my ass. In my gut. In the way he was grinding into me, milking something deep inside me I didn’t know was there.
I felt it build. A different kind of orgasm. No touching. No stroking. Just waves. Pressure. Release. My body tensed, arched, cried out.
And when Thiago pushed all the way in and came — his final load, hot and deep — my whole body shook with it. I groaned as he pulsed inside me, my hole clenching around him like I didn’t want to let go.
He pulled out slowly. Then grabbed my face and turned it toward him.
His mouth crashed into mine — rough, full of tongue and teeth. I didn’t fight it. I opened up for him. Gave him everything. Let him take control.
When he was done, he stood up. Put his uniform back on.
I stayed in bed, still on my stomach, still leaking.
He walked to the door. Opened it.
That same smirk from yesterday curled across his face as he looked at his handy work.
"You not so straight anymore," he said.
And then he was gone. The door clicked shut behind him.
I closed my eyes again.
I couldn’t deny it.
